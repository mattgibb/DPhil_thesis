This thesis is the culmination of many year's work and would not have
been possible without the help and support of many
people. 

I would like to thank my supervisors Drs. Martin Bishop, Blanca Rodriguez and Vicente Grau. 

Martin:
Friendship, practical expertise, professional advice, life coaching, help with pretty much everything.

Blanca:
Vision, guidance, scientific context, writing, structure, direction, outcome, purpose, project planning and management.

Vicente:
Explanation of complex algorithms, imaging genius, clarity and insight through problems and failures.

All my supervisors have shown Olympian patience, generosity, support and care. I am a profoundly wiser and more able person having worked with them, and I look forward to returning their kindness in the future.
