  In this chapter we discuss previous work examining cardiac anatomy near the cellular scale and its influence on organ-scale function. We first motivate and direct our line of enquiry with experimental evidence, showing how microstructure has a profound effect on propagation dynamics and is central to future antitachycardia pacing treatments. Secondly, we detail the various sources of data available to us to fully characterise this structure, and weigh up their relative advantages and problems. Thirdly, we review the recent attempts to build coherent and geometrically accurate volumes from histology data. Finally, we explore the efforts made in the field to date to incorporate detailed anatomy into models for simulation, again demonstrating the important function of microstructure.
