CONFIRMATION THESIS
A review of the contemporary literature concerning cardiac microstructure and fibre orientation was included in the transfer thesis. This chapter discusses previous work examining cardiac anatomy near the cellular scale and its influence on organ-scale function. The line of enquiry is first motivated and directed with experimental evidence, showing how microstructure has a profound effect upon propagation dynamics and is central to future antitachycardia pacing treatments. Secondly, the efforts made in the field to incorporate detailed anatomy into models for simulation are explored, again demonstrating the important function of microstructure. Thirdly, the various sources of data available to fully characterise this structure are detailed, comparing their relative advantages and problems.
