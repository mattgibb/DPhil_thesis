In this chapter we review some central background to the coming chapters. A synopsis of cardiac anatomy is followed by a brief on the electrophysiolical structure and function of the heart on the cellular, tissue and organ scale. First we discuss the overall activation sequence during one full beat of the heart, along with the problems that can arise during this process. We go on to discuss the cellular machinery which transduces this cycle, and how tissue structure mediates its propagation. We explain a commonly implemented continuum-based model of wave propagation known as the bidomain model, and examine how this model can be simulated upon three-dimensional finite element meshes, constructed from morphologies extracted from medical images. We conclude the chapter with an overview of the imaging techniques that are used to reconstruct and align volumes from raw imaging data, and then to extract the tissue features and morphologies from the volumes.
