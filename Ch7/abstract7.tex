In this chapter, we develop quantitative methods to discern orientation information from 2D and 3D images, based on what is known as the structure tensor. We validate the methods on a single 2D region of left-ventricular myocardial wall and demonstrate that, given images of the required detail and coherence, orientation at a range of scales can be inferred with a high degree of accuracy. We extract volumetric image gradients from the reconstructed images in Chapter~\ref{cha:diffusion_smoothing_registration_of_high_resolution_rat_histology}, in the hope that these gradients will correlate closely with the local myocardial fibre direction. We establish that in this case, even extremely small registrational abberations lead to large artificial increases in intensity gradients perpendicular to the histological plane, hindering the faithful extraction of fibre direction for inclusion in models for electrophysiological simulation.
