\section{Aims} % (fold)
\label{sec:aims}
  Having obtained a coherent histological volume in a region around an epicardial vessel, the challenge remains to extract an accurate, anatomically based model of tissue microstructure from the volume. The model would serve firstly as an anatomical reference, but also to facilitate realistic simulations investigating the role of microstructure in electrophysiological wave propagation, and quantifying the functional consequences of incorporating microstructure into models.
  
  We aim to construct a mathematically sound way to quantify the size and orientation of image intensity gradients at the scale of myocardial fibres and of interstitial planes. The methods can then be tested in 2D, within specific regions of the intrinsically coherent single histological slice images. With the validated methods, we can then attempt to extract meaningful microstructural information from full registered histological volumes.

  \subsection{The Structure Tensor} % (fold)
  \label{sub:the_structure_tensor}
    We can construct a matrix $S_0$ from the Cartesian product of the gradient of an image $I$. For illustrative purposes, let us consider a 2-dimensional image $I(x,y)$, so that
  
    \begin{align}
      S_0 &= \nabla I^T \, \nabla I \\
          &= \begin{pmatrix}
        I_x \\
        I_y
      \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
        I_x && I_y
      \end{pmatrix} \\
          &= \begin{pmatrix}
            I_x^2 && I_xI_y \\
            I_xI_y && I_y^2
          \end{pmatrix}.
    \end{align}
  
    Because of the associativity of matrix multiplication, we can see that a multiplication of a vector $v$ with any matrix constructed from the Cartesian product of a vector $u$ will simply result in a vector parallel to $u$, with magnitude equal to the dot product of $v$ and $u$ multiplied by the magnitude of $u$. In our case,
  
    \begin{align}
      S_0 \mathbf{v} &= (\nabla I^T \, \nabla I) \mathbf{v} \\
                     &= (\nabla I \cdot \mathbf{v}) \nabla I^T.
    \end{align}
  
    From this it is clear that $S_0$ is a tensor with two eigenvectors, parallel with and perpendicular to $\nabla I$, with eigenvalues of $|\nabla I|^2$ and 0, respectively.
  
    The structure tensor $S_w$ is a matrix derived from this Cartesian product of the gradient of an image, which gives a measure of the magnitude and coherence of changes in intensity across a small image region. It is defined as the weighted mean of $S_0$ within a surrounding window $w$ of a given point in $I$. Equivalently, it is the convolution of $S_0$ with the windowing function.
  
    If the gradients are all coherently aligned well within a window, the largest eigenvector of the resulting $S_w$ will be much greater than the other eigenvectors, and in 3-D, the tensor will take a long, thin shape. Clearly, $S_0$ is itself perfectly coherent. Gradients may also be distributed throughout a subspace of the entire space; in 3-D, gradients varying evenly within a 2-D plane will result in a flat, disc-shaped tensor, with one small eigenvalue associated with a vector perpendicular to that plane. If gradients are more isotropic, then all eigenvalues will be of a similar magnitude, giving a spherical tensor, and a zero tensor can only obtained if the gradient is zero throughout the windowing region.
  
    In a perfectly registered histological volume, and at the scale of individual myocardial cells, the smallest intensity gradients will be found parallel to the fibre direction, and the largest in the plane perpendicular to them. The structure tensors should therefore appear disc-shaped, with their short axis aligned with the muscle fibres. At the larger scale of myocardial sheets, we would expect javelin-shaped tensors with one eigenvalue much larger than the other two, oriented perpendicularly to the sheet plane. In this case, and depending on scale and smoothing, we might expect that the smallest eigenvalue would be oriented in the predominant fibre direction.

      \label{fig:2D_segmentation}
    \end{figure}
  
    As a proof of concept, we segment the sheet structure and apply the structure tensor to a section of myocardial wall in a single histological slice image, thereby extracting the local in-plane sheet angle across the entire section. Figure~\ref{fig:2D_full_slice} shows the sliver of lower left-ventricular wall that was selected for this purpose from a central rat heart slice. An enlarged view of the sliver is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2D_segmentation}, along with images of the segmentation process employed to distinguish tissue, chamber and external regions.
  
    It is clear from Figure~\ref{fig:2D_segmentation}~(a) that the myocardial tissue sheets are separated by a great many interstitial clefts, which vary sharply and coherently in direction across the wall. In order to quantify this variation, it is necessary to extract the clefts themselves, and then to measure their orientation relative to the internal and external edges. The long, thin cleft structures must be distinguished from other larger holes in the tissue with no clear angle of orientation, such as myocardial vessels. An overall tissue segmentation has already been manually selected -- as the complement of the two large external blue and internal yellow regions in Figure~\ref{fig:2D_segmentation}~(d). A further threshold segmentation of all near-white pixels is applied, within the overall manual tissue segmentation, and is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2D_cleft_extraction}~(a). Any region wider than the characteristic width of a cleft is segmented with a morphological opening procedure (Figure~\ref{fig:2D_cleft_extraction}~(b)), and these areas are removed from the original threshold (Figure~\ref{fig:2D_cleft_extraction}~(c)). The structure tensor is calculated at each pixel of the image, and a Gaussian smoothing is applied independently to each of the four scalar elements of the tensor field in order to reduce noise. The orientation at any position within a cleft is then inferred as the direction along the tensor eigenvector associated with the smallest eigenvalue, and thus the lowest intensity gradient.

      \caption{A threshold segmentation of all inter-tissue spaces is presented in \textbf{(a)}. Spaces wider than a cleft are determined through the application of an opening filter, of which \textbf{(b)} is the result. These wider spaces are subtracted from the original segmentation in \textbf{(c)}, leaving only the cleft spaces. The normalised distance parameter from endo- to epicardium $e$ is then calculated for each pixel in \textbf{(c)}, plotted as a continuous colourmap in \textbf{(d)}.}
      \label{fig:2D_cleft_extraction}
    \end{figure}
  
    It is conventional in the literature to parameterise the space within the external heart wall with $e$: the normalised relative Euclidian distance from endo- to epicardium. $e$ is defined as zero on the endocardial surface and $1$ on the epicardial surface. It is interesting to explore the relation between $e$ and cleft orientation, and certainly from Figure~\ref{fig:2D_segmentation}~(a), the myocardium appears to be composed of several distinct layers of cleft orientation in a zig-zag pattern, highly coherent within themselves, but sharply angled relative to one another. We apply Euclidian distance transforms to obtain the distances $d_{\text{endo}}$ and $d_{\text{epi}}$ from the internal chamber and the external cavity segmentations, respectively. Armed with the two distances at each pixel, we compute a 2-dimensional value for $e$ throughout the tissue segmentation thusly:
  
    \begin{equation}
      e = \frac{d_{\text{endo}}}{d_{\text{endo}} + d_{\text{epi}} }.
    \end{equation}
  
    A continuous colourmap of the $e$ parameter across the segmented clefts is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:2D_cleft_extraction}.

  \subsection{3D Volumes} % (fold)
  \label{sub:3d_volumes}
    Motivated by the findings from the 2D analysis, we apply the structure tensor to the regionally registered block from Section~\ref{sub:regional_diffusion}. However, before any orientation analysis can be performed, it is crucial to ensure the same sampling rate within the plane of the slices as is between them, so that artificial anisotropy is not introduced. A volume is therefore constructed from slice images that are downsampled and Gaussian smoothed so as to have the same spatial resolution of 10$\mu$m as the slicing. The structure tensor is computed across the isotropic volume, and a Gaussian windowing kernel is then applied to the tensor, with $\sigma$ equal to the pixel spacing.

    Figure~\ref{fig:structure_tensor_glyphs} illustrates the form of the structure tensor across the central histological slice of the epicardial block. A regular grid of spheroid glyphs are plotted at each pixel of the slice, with principal axes aligned and proportional to the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the structure tensor. It is evident that the largest tensors are not, as expected, disc-like, but in fact javelin-like, as one eigenvalue greatly exceeds the other two. It is also evident that larger tensors are oriented predominantly in the z-direction perpendicular to the plane. Figure~\ref{fig:eigencomponents} echoes this finding, showing grayscale images of the magnitudes of the three components of the largest eigenvector. By far the brightest image is that of the z-component. This dominance is also expressed in the largely blue appearance of Figure~\ref{fig:eigencomponents} (d), with only small tinges of red and green. Unfortunately in this case, even extremely small displacements of the slices relative to each other has been enough to drown the gradient signal from the fibre direction.

\section{Discussion} % (fold)
  2D: We surveyed X number of slices in 4 regions, but the results were too noisy to draw reasonable conclusions from.
  
  The dominance of intensity gradient in the z-direction is a result of slices being very slightly out of alignment with each other, by the distance of the width of a cell or greater. Unfortunately, the misalignment often leads to a `zig-zagging' of intensities perpendicular to the slices and at the frequency of the slicing, which manifests as an inflated z-gradient. An attempt to extract fibre direction and incorporate this information into a model would sadly be fruitless in this context.
  
  There are a number of things which can be explored to correct for this z-dominance. Filter things so that the gradient components in all directions are approximately similar, either by rescaling the gradients or by 
  
  For 3D: This is the preliminary work for this, rather than saying `this cannot work'.
