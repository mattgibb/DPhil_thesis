  \subsection{Problem}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Underlying noise in reference images, from changes in camera position and illumination angles and intensities
      \item Resolution of reference images are 8 times coarser at 8.8$\mu$ 
      \item Large discontinuities in camera position have already been corrected for in the block reference images, introducing the `banana problem' across the discontinuity
      \item Small non-rigid deformations when tissue is sliced and rehydrated, different in every slice and not fully represented by an affine transform.
      \item Registration close, but does not always find the global minimum.

  \subsection{A 1D Random Walk Analogy}
  The central limit theorem states that the mean of a sufficiently large number of independent random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of their individual distribution. Indeed, Einstein's theory of the Brownian motion of a diffusive particle is based on this precept. With this in mind, the simplest model of microscopic diffusion is one in which a particle may move in a random walk in one dimension along the integer number line $\mathbb{Z}$, in steps of either $+1$ or $-1$, with equal probability. Taking each step as an independent random variable $Z_1, Z_2,\ldots$, if the particle's position $S$ starts at $S_0 = 0$, we can express the position of the particle after $N$ steps as
  \begin{equation}
    S_N = \sum\limits_{i=1}^N Z_i .
  \end{equation}
  The probability of taking $k$ positive steps out of a total of $N$ steps is given by
  \begin{equation}
    P(k;N) = \binom{N}{k}\left(\frac{1}{2} \right)^N,
  \end{equation}
  where the binomial coefficient
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:registration:binomial-coefficient}
     \binom{N}{k} = \frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!},
  \end{equation}
  since there are $\binom{N}{k}$ possible ways of taking $k$ and $N - k$ steps of $-1$ and $+1$, respectively. At each independent step, the probability of taking one or the other direction is $\frac{1}{2}$, leading to the product $\frac{1}{2}^N$.
  
  Applying Stirling's approximation:
  \begin{align}
    \label{eq:registration:stirling}
    \ln \left( n! \right) &= n\ln n - n + O(\ln n) \notag \\
           &\approx n\ln n - n \quad \text{as}\: n \to \infty,
  \end{align}
  
  \emph{Possibly include proof of de Moivre-Laplace theorem.}
  % Proof can be found here:
  % http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Moivre%E2%80%93Laplace_theorem
  We can see that in the limit of large $N$, the distribution of $k$ and thus $S_N$ tend to Gaussian:
  \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:registration:gaussian-approximation}
    \binom{N}{k}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^N \approx \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi N}} \
      e^{-2(k - \frac{N}{2})^2/N}
  \end{equation}
  
  Show diagrams of half particles stepping once left, half right.
  
  It is clear from Equation~\ref{eq:registration:gaussian-approximation} that multiple application of this smoothing operation approximates a Gaussian diffusion smoothing.

  
  We might consider a concentration of particles $f$ over a discrete 1-dimensional grid $x$. After a discretised timestep $\Delta t$, a proportion $\alpha$ of the particles have taken a random walk, such that half of them have diffused to the left and half to the right:
  
  \begin{align}
    f(x_i, t_{n+1}) &= f(x_i, t_n) + \alpha (f(x_{i-1}, t_n) - 2f(x_i, t_n) + f(x_{i+1}, t_n)), \\
    \Delta f(x, t + \Delta t) &= \alpha (f(x - \Delta x, t) - 2f(x, t) + f(x + \Delta x, t)). \end{align}

  Parameters used for noisy dummies were x, y, z. The important factor is whether the slice-to-slice registrations are quickly and robustly successful, and so much greater noise could be filtered by the algorithm, as long as the parameters were tuned for large displacements for the first few iterations, and then smaller displacements for the finer smoothing in the later iterations.
  
  Parameter tuning:
  Initial discussion of 4 parameters in RSGD: 2 behavioural (max step and relaxation factor), and 2 cutoff(min step and gradient magnitude tolerance).
  Figures need to compare:
    increase/decrease in behavioural (zigzag if too high because of overshoot)
  increase/decrease in cutoff (takes too long if low, see tails in plot metric values and differences, doesn't finish if too high, use compare final metric values.py)
  
  Increase max step for HiRes pairs registration to 60, and show characteristic zigzagging and jumping out of potential well
  
  Prove that random walk is binomial distribution, which tends to Gaussian distribution, therefore with enough iterations we are applying gaussian transformational smoothing to the volume.
  
  Particles undergoing brownian motion diffuse, hence the name.

  \label{sub:2d_transforms_diffusion}
    This 1-dimensional model is trivially extended to a 2D translation of a slice image aligning with its neighbour, since both of the parameters are mutually orthogonal. But what about the more complex harder with say affine transform. Square root of transform blah blah.

\section{Discussion} % (fold)
\label{sec:discussion}
  GENERAL POINT, `it will be shown later' in introductory paragraphs, to tittilate the reader.

  With a better interpolation scheme, it might be possible to crank alpha up further.
  
  Inherently introduces the banana problem across the curvature of the heart (~30 slices - give justification with numbers)
  Can only be used for small adjustments, given non-commutativity of operators etc.
  Figures and evaluation of results e.g. examples of great and bad slice-pair registrations, maybe one slice has a large abberation. Works better for different regions? e.g. round blob versus cavity?
  Alternative Implementations:
  Could register to more than just nearest neighbours at each iteration, although multiple iterations of nearest neighbour is equivalent to this, requires the same total number of slice-to-slice iterations, and is more stable and accurate, as errors from the first nearest neighbour iteration due to e.g. interpolation error, random noise etc. are mitigated by subsequent iterations.
  Expensive to rerun slice-pair registrations every iteration, could infer from previous registration. Inaccuracy and instability?
  
  Could be extended easily to more complex transforms such as b-spline, although perhaps a little trickier to think about interpolating transforms other than linearly interpolating their parameters.
