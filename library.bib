abstract = {Many important high throughput projects use in situ hybridization and may require the analysis of images of spatial cross sections of organisms taken with cellular level resolution. Projects creating gene expression atlases at unprecedented scales for the embryonic fruit fly as well as the embryonic and adult mouse already involve the analysis of hundreds of thousands of high resolution experimental images mapping mRNA expression patterns. Challenges include accurate registration of highly deformed tissues, associating cells with known anatomical regions, and identifying groups of genes whose expression is coordinately regulated with respect to both concentration and spatial location. Solutions to these and other challenges will lead to a richer understanding of the complex system aspects of gene regulation in heterogeneous tissue.},

abstract = {The function of the ventricular specialized conduction system in the heart is to ensure the coordinated electrical activation of the ventricles. It is therefore critical to the overall function of the heart, and has also been implicated as an important player in various diseases, including lethal ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation and drug-induced torsades de pointes. However, current ventricular models of electrophysiology usually ignore, or include highly simplified representations of the specialized conduction system. Here, we describe the development of an image-based, species-consistent, anatomically-detailed model of rabbit ventricular electrophysiology that incorporates a detailed description of the free-running part of the specialized conduction system. Techniques used for the construction of the geometrical model of the specialized conduction system from a magnetic resonance dataset and integration of the system model into a ventricular anatomical model, developed from the same dataset, are described. Computer simulations of rabbit ventricular electrophysiology are conducted using the novel anatomical model and rabbit-specific membrane kinetics to investigate the importance of the components and properties of the conduction system in determining ventricular function under physiological conditions. Simulation results are compared to panoramic optical mapping experiments for model validation and results interpretation. Full access is provided to the anatomical models developed in this study.},

abstract = {Abstract Guinea pig hearts were stained with a voltage-sensitive dye and imaged on a photodiode array to record fluorescent action potentials (APs) from 124 sites. Activation and repolarization patterns were recorded from the epicardium during stimulation at different loci and correlated with the underlying fiber architecture. Endocardial APs were recorded by inserting a light guide into the ventricular cavity or by dissecting out the ventricular free wall to expose the endocardium. In hearts paced on the right atrium to simulate sinus rhythm, activation emerged synchronously over a large area of the ventricular epicardium and spread laterally in 5 to 7 ms. The apparent longitudinal and transverse velocities were 2.66\{+/-\}0.11 and 1.65\{+/-\}0.09 m/s (n=12). In contrast, repolarization began near the apex on the endocardium and spread transmurally in 6\{+/-\}1.3 ms (n=12) and then anisotropically along the epicardium in 25 to 30 ms with apparent maximum (0.53\{+/-\}0.11 m/s) and minimum (0.31\{+/-\}0.10 m/s) repolarization velocities that aligned with the longitudinal and transverse axes of epicardial fibers. When paced on the epicardium, activation of intact hearts (n=12) and perfused sheets (n=8) was anisotropic, with longitudinal (0.85\{+/-\}0.05 m/s) and transverse (0.44\{+/-\}0.04 m/s) conduction velocities that aligned with the epicardial fiber orientation. When activation was initiated at different sites on the epicardium, repolarization always began near the apex and exhibited patterns similar to those obtained under right atrial pacing, but with slower longitudinal (0.41\{+/-\}0.09 m/s) and transverse (0.23\{+/-\}0.07 m/s) repolarization velocities (n=18). In sheets stretched parallel to the longitudinal axis of surface fibers, AP durations (APDs) increased as a function of fiber length, from the length at zero developed tension to 120\% of the length at maximum developed tension (Lmax). Spatial distributions of APDs did not change during stretches along the rising phase of the length-tension curve. In sheets stretched to 50\% of Lmax, APDs were shorter and more homogeneous on the endocardium (mean APD, 188 ms; \{Delta\}APD, 195-186=9 ms) than on the epicardium (mean APD, 204 ms; \{Delta\}APD, 212-186=26 ms; n=8). In guinea pig hearts, activation is rapid; therefore, repolarization depends primarily on intrinsic spatial heterogeneities of APDs. Consequently, repolarization begins at endocardial cells with the shortest APDs and spreads transmurally and then anisotropically on the surface according to the epicardial cell orientation.},

abstract = {A heart-torso model including fiber orientation is used to calculate electric field strength in an active-can transvenous defibrillation system and estimate errors due to inadequate description of the anisotropy of the myocardium. Using a minimum potential gradient (5 V/cm) in a critical mass (95\%) of the tissue, the estimated defibrillation voltage threshold for a right ventricular transvenous lead placement differs by only 4.5\% when using isotropic myocardial conductivity compared to a model with realistic fiber architecture. In addition, pointwise comparisons of the two solutions reveal differences of 10.8\% rms in potential gradient strength and 31.6\% rms in current density magnitude in the myocardium, resulting in a change in the location of the low gradient regions. These results suggest that if a minimum potential gradient throughout the heart is necessary to avoid reinitiation of fibrillatory wave fronts, then isotropic models are adequate for modeling the electric field in the heart. Alternatively, the model demonstrates the use of physiologically based descriptions of anisotropy and fiber orientation, which will soon allow simulations of shock induced membrane polarization during defibrillation.},

abstract = {In the past years, the development of 3-D medical imaging has enabled the 3-D imaging of in vivo tissues, from an anatomical (MR, CT) or even functional (fMRI, PET, SPECT) point of view. However, despite immense technological progress, the resolution of these images is still short of the level of anatomical or functional details that in vitro imaging (e.g., histology, autoradiography) permits. The motivation of this work is to compare fMRI activations to activations observed in autoradiographic images from the same animals. We aim to fuse post-mortem autoradiographic data with a pre-mortem anatomical MR image. We first reconstruct a 3-D volume from the 2-D autoradiographic sections, coherent both in geometry and intensity. Then, this volume is fused with the MR image. This way, we ensure that the reconstructed 3-D volume can be superimposed onto the MR image that represents the reference anatomy. We demonstrate that this fusion can be achieved by using only simple global transformations (rigid and/or affine, 2-D and 3-D), while yielding very satisfactory results.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple excitation wavelets are present during ventricular fibrillation (VF). The underlying wavelet organization of VF is unclear. Phase singularities (PSs)-locations of ambiguous activation state-underlie reentry and wavelet splitting and represent the sources of VF. Understanding the mechanisms of PS formation might be important in the development of effective therapies for sudden death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed voltage, phase, and PS mapping in fibrillating ventricles, applying an automated PS detection algorithm to optically recorded fibrillation signals. PS clustering was noted along epicardial vessels, ridges of endocardial trabeculae, and papillary muscle insertions. Microscopically, these locations correlated with areas of apposition of fibers with different angulations and intramural vessels. A total of 83.2\% of PSs were formed at and meandered about these anatomic structures, which acted as stabilizers: PSs colocalizing at anatomic substrates had longer life spans than nonanatomic PS (82.46+/-60.8 versus 40.5+/-31.9 ms, P<0.01). The RV endocardium had a higher PS incidence than the epicardium (42.3+/-9.2 versus 23.5+/-11.6 PS/s, P<0.01). Autocorrelation showed that irregular behavior was spatially restricted to anatomic heterogeneities compared with other areas, which had nearly periodic behaviors. Simple spatial PS distributions underlay complex and variable activation patterns attributable to variable PS behaviors, life spans, and inter-PS interactions. CONCLUSIONS: PSs occur in a nonrandom spatial distribution and colocalize with normal anatomic heterogeneities. Varying PS behaviors and life spans but stable PS spatial distributions cause ever-changing activation patterns that characterize VF.},

@article{Xie2004,
abstract = {In ventricular fibrillation (VF), the principal cause of sudden cardiac death, waves of electrical excitation break up into turbulent and incoherent fragments. The causes of this breakup have been intensely debated. Breakup can be caused by fixed anatomical properties of the tissue, such as the biventricular geometry and the inherent anisotropy of cardiac conduction. However, wavebreak can also be caused purely by instabilities in wave conduction that arise from ion channel dynamics, which represent potential targets for drug action. To study the interaction between these two wave-breaking mechanisms, we used a physiologically based mathematical model of the ventricular cell, together with a realistic three-dimensional computer model of cardiac anatomy, including the distribution of fiber angles throughout the myocardium. We find that dynamical instabilities remain a major cause of the wavebreak that drives VF, even in an anatomically realistic heart. With cell physiology in its usual operating regime, dynamics and anatomical features interact to promote wavebreak and VF. However, if dynamical instability is reduced, for example by modeling of certain pharmacologic interventions, electrical waves do not break up into fibrillation, despite anatomical complexity. Thus, interventions that promote dynamical wave stability show promise as an antifibrillatory strategy in this more realistic setting.},

Reconstruction of histology volume from serial sections is a well-established procedure, but it does not address registration of individual slices from sparse sections, which is the aim of the slice-to-volume approach. This study presents a flexible framework for intensity-based slice-to-volume nonrigid registration algorithms with a geometric transformation deformation field parametrized by various classes of spline functions: thin-plate splines (TPS), Gaussian elastic body splines (GEBS), or cubic B-splines. Algorithms are applied to cross-modality registration of histological and magnetic resonance images of the human brain. Registration performance is evaluated across a range of optimization algorithms and intensity-based cost functions. For a particular case of histological data, best results are obtained with a TPS three-dimensional (3D) warp, a new unconstrained optimization algorithm (NEWUOA), and a correlation-coefficient-based cost function.},

abstract = {Heart failure leads to gross cardiac structural changes. While cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a recognized treatment for restoring synchronous activation, it is not clear how changes in cardiac shape and size affect the electrical pacing therapy. This study used a human heart computer model which incorporated anatomical structures such as myofiber orientation and a Purkinje system (PS) to study how pacing affected failing hearts. The PS was modeled as a tree structure that reproduced its retrograde activation feature. In addition to a normal geometry, two cardiomyopathies were modeled: dilatation and hypertrophy. A biventricular pacing protocol was tested in the context of atrio-ventricular block. The contribution of the PS was examined by removing it, as well as by increasing endocardial conductivity. Results showed that retrograde conduction into the PS was a determining factor for achieving intraventricular synchrony. Omission of the PS led to an overestimate of the degree of electrical dyssynchrony while assessing CRT. The activation patterns for the three geometries showed local changes in the order of activation of the lateral wall in response to the same pacing strategy. These factors should be carefully considered when determining lead placement and optimizing device parameters in clinical practice.},

With this system it is possible to reconstruct specified morphological features in three dimensions and locate them accurately throughout a tissue sample. We have successfully imaged various samples at 1-mum voxel resolution on volumes up to 4 mm3 and on areas up to 75 mm2.

abstract = {Digital and print brain atlases have been used with success to help in the planning of neurosurgical interventions. In this paper, a technique presented for the creation of a brain atlas of the basal ganglia and the thalamus derived from serial histological data. Photographs of coronal histological sections were digitized and anatomical structures were manually segmented. A slice-to-slice nonlinear registration technique was used to correct for spatial distortions introduced into the histological data set at the time of acquisition. Since the histological data were acquired without any anatomical reference (e.g., block-face imaging, post-mortem MRI), this registration technique was optimized to use an error metric which calculates a nonlinear transformation minimizing the mean distance between the segmented contours between adjacent pairs of slices in the data set. A voxel-by-voxel intensity correction field was also estimated for each slice to correct for lighting and staining inhomogeneity. The reconstructed three-dimensional (3D) histological volume can be viewed in transverse and sagittal directions in addition to the original coronal. Nonlinear transformations used to correct for spatial distortions of the histological data were applied to the segmented structure contours. These contours were then tessellated to create three-dimensional geometric objects representing the different anatomic regions in register with the histological volumes. This yields two alternate representations (one histological and one geometric) of the atlas. To register the atlas to a standard reference MR volume created from the average of 27 T1-weighted MR volumes, a pseudo-MRI was created by setting the intensity of each anatomical region defined in the geometric atlas to match the intensity of the corresponding region of the reference MR volume. This allowed the estimation of a 3D nonlinear transformation using a correlation based registration scheme to fit the atlas to the reference MRI. The result of this procedure is a contiguous 3D histological volume, a set of 3D objects defining the basal ganglia and thalamus, both of which are registered to a standard MRI data set, for use for neurosurgical planning.},

abstract = {AIMS: The pathological proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in response to heart injury results in fibrosis, which correlates with arrhythmia generation and heart failure. Here we systematically examined the effect of fibroblast-derived paracrine factors on electrical propagation in cardiomyocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Neonatal rat cardiac monolayers were exposed for 24 h to media conditioned by CFs. Optical mapping, sharp microelectrode recordings, quantitative RT-PCR, and immunostaining were used to assess the changes in the propagation and shape of the action potential and underlying changes in gene and protein expression. The fibroblast paracrine factors produced a 52\% reduction in cardiac conduction velocity, a 217\% prolongation of action potential duration, a 64\% decrease of maximum capture rate, a 21\% increase in membrane resting potential, and an 80\% decrease of action potential upstroke velocity. These effects were dose dependent and partially reversible with removal of the conditioned media. No fibroblast proliferation, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, or decreased connexin-43 expression, phosphorylation, and function were found in conditioned cardiac cultures. In contrast, the expression of the fast sodium, inward rectifying potassium, and transient outward potassium channels were, respectively, reduced 3.8-, 6.6-fold, and to undetectable levels. The expression of beta-myosin heavy chain increased 17.4-fold. No electrophysiological changes were observed from media conditioned by CFs in the presence of cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSION: Paracrine factors from neonatal CFs alone produced significant electrophysiological changes in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes resembling those found in several cardiac pathologies.},

abstract = {Fiber organization is important for myocardial excitation and contraction. It can be a major factor in arrhythmogenesis and current distribution during defibrillation shocks. In this study, we report the discovery of a previously undetected thin epicardial layer in swine right ventricle (RV) with distinctly different fiber orientation, which significantly affects epicardial propagation. Experiments were conducted in isolated coronary-perfused right ventricular free wall preparations (n=8) stained with the voltage-sensitive dye di-4-ANEPPS. Optical signals were recorded from the epicardium with a CCD video camera at 800 fps. Preparations were sectioned parallel to the epicardial surface with a resolution of 50 mum or better. To link the histological data with the observed activation patterns, resulting fiber angles were introduced into a 3D computer model to simulate the electrical activation and voltage-dependent optical signals. In all preparations, we detected a thin epicardial layer with almost no depth-dependent fiber rotation. The thickness of this layer (z(0)) varied from 110 to 930 microm. At the boundary of this layer, we observed an abrupt change in fiber angle by 64+/-13 degrees followed by a gradual fiber rotation in the underlying layers. In preparations with z(0) <700 microm, optical mapping during epicardial stimulation revealed unusual diamond- and rectangular-shaped activation fronts with two axes of fast conduction. Computer simulations accurately predicted the features of the experimentally recorded activation fronts. The free wall of swine RV has a thin epicardial layer with distinctly different fiber orientation, which can significantly affect propagation and give rise to unusually shaped activation fronts. This is important for understanding electrical propagation in the heart, and further refines the existing knowledge of myocardial fiber architecture.},

abstract = {Little is known about the three-dimensional (3-D) intramural activation sequences during long-duration ventricular fibrillation (VF), including the role of the subendocardium and its Purkinje fibers (PFs) in long-duration VF maintenance. Our aim was to explore the mechanism of long-duration VF maintenance with 3-D electrical mapping. We recorded 10 min of electrically induced VF in the left ventricular anterior free wall of six 10-kg, open-chest dogs using a 3-D transmural unipolar electrode matrix (9 x 9 x 6, 2-mm spacing) that allowed us to map intramural activation sequences. At 2.5 + or - 1.8 min of VF, although the body surface ECG continued to exhibit a disorganized VF pattern, intramurally a more organized, synchronous activation pattern was first observed [locally synchronized VF (LSVF)]. This pattern occurred one or more times in all dogs and was present 33.4 + or - 31.4\% of the time during 5-10 min of VF. As opposed to the preceding changing complex activation sequences of VF, during LSVF, wavefronts were large and highly repeatable near the endocardium, first exciting the endocardium almost simultaneously and then rapidly spreading toward the epicardium with different levels of conduction block en route. During LSVF, PF activations always preceded working myocardium activations near the endocardium. In conclusion, long-duration VF in dogs frequently becomes highly organized in the subendocardium, with activation fronts arising in this region and passing intramurally toward the epicardium, even though the surface ECG continues to exhibit a disorganized pattern. PFs appear to play an important role during this stage of VF.},

abstract = {The diffusion tensor is currently the accepted model of diffusion in biological tissues. The measured diffusion behavior may be more complex when two or more distinct tissues with different diffusion tensors occupy the same voxel. In this study, a partial volume model of MRI signal behavior for two diffusion-tensor compartments is presented. Simulations using this model demonstrate that the conventional single diffusion tensor model could lead to highly variable and inaccurate measurements of diffusion behavior. The differences between the single and two-tensor models depend on the orientations, fractions, and exchange between the two diffusion tensor compartments, as well as the diffusion-tensor encoding technique and diffusion-weighting that is used in the measurements. The current single compartment model's inaccuracies could cause diffusion-based characterization of cerebral ischemia and white matter connectivity to be incorrect. A diffusion-tensor MRI imaging experiment on a normal human brain revealed significant partial volume effects between oblique white matter regions when using very large voxels and large diffusion-weighting (b approximately 2.69 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)). However, the apparent partial volume effects in white matter decreased significantly when smaller voxel dimensions were used. For diffusion tensor studies obtained using typical diffusion-weighting values (b approximately 1 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)) partial volume effects are much more difficult to detect and resolve. More accurate measurements of multiple diffusion compartments may lead to improved confidence in diffusion measurements for clinical applications.},

abstract = {Voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes are commonly used to measure cardiac electrical activity. Recent studies indicate, however, that optical action potentials (OAPs) recorded from the myocardial surface originate from a widely distributed volume beneath the surface and may contain useful information regarding intramural activation. The first step toward obtaining this information is to predict OAPs from known patterns of three-dimensional (3-D) electrical activity. To achieve this goal, we developed a two-stage model in which the output of a 3-D ionic model of electrical excitation serves as the input to an optical model of light scattering and absorption inside heart tissue. The two-stage model permits unique optical signatures to be obtained for given 3-D patterns of electrical activity for direct comparison with experimental data, thus yielding information about intramural electrical activity. To illustrate applications of the model, we simulated surface fluorescence signals produced by 3-D electrical activity during epicardial and endocardial pacing. We discovered that OAP upstroke morphology was highly sensitive to the transmural component of wave front velocity and could be used to predict wave front orientation with respect to the surface. These findings demonstrate the potential of the model for obtaining useful 3-D information about intramural propagation.},

abstract = {This review examines the initiation of reentry in cardiac muscle by strong electric shocks. Specifically, it concentrates on the mechanisms by which electric shocks change the transmembrane potential of the cardiac membrane and create the physiological substrate required by the critical point theory for the initiation of rotors. The mechanisms examined include (1) direct polarization of the tissue by the stimulating current, as described by the one-dimensional cable model and its two- and three-dimensional extensions, (2) the presence of virtual anodes and cathodes, as described by the bidomain model with unequal anisotropy ratios of the intra- and extracellular spaces, (3) polarization of the tissue due to changing orientation of cardiac fibers, and (4) polarization of individual cells or groups of cells by the electric field ("sawtooth potential"). The importance of these mechanisms in the initiation of reentry is examined in two case studies: the induction of rotors using successive stimulation with a unipolar electrode, and the induction of rotors using cross-field stimulation. These cases reveal that the mechanism by which a unipolar stimulation induces arrhythmias can be explained in the framework of the bidomain model with unequal anisotropy ratios. In contrast, none of the examined mechanisms provide an adequate explanation for the induction of rotors by cross-field stimulation. Hence, this study emphasizes the need for further experimental and theoretical work directed toward explaining the mechanism of field stimulation. (c) 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

The large number of measurements required to estimate angular deviation prohibits manual measurement. We describe methods for automated measurement of local orientation and angular deviation in tissue sections from transgenic mice with ventricular expression of ras, proposed as a model of FHC.Images of histologic tissue sections from normal and transgenic mice were analyzed using image processing techniques to estimate local orientation of myofibers. Results from the automated methods were compared with manual measurements.Automated methods estimated differing mean orientation in 7-20\% of normal sections and 17-29\% of transgenic tissue sections with differing dispersions in 23-30\% of normal sections and 25\% of transgenic tissue sections. Automated methods estimate 24.47 +/- 13.03\% of total ventricular mass affected by disarray that is comparable to a previous estimate of 21.7\% in the same mouse model.Automated methods are a rapid and accurate alternative to manual measurement for estimation of mean orientation and angular deviation in myocardial tissue sections. Differences between manual and automated methods may be attributed to the substantially larger number of measurements made by automated methods. Automated methods are particularly appropriate for use in determining local variation in orientation such as focal myofiber disarray associated with FHC. The generality of these methods suggests they may have use in other biological fields such as quantifying cellular alignment. Anat Rec. 252:612-625, 1998. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The relative importance of nonuniform dispersion of refractoriness, steep restitution slopes, and anatomic heterogeneities in causing conduction block during ventricular fibrillation (VF) remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: In six open-chest pigs, ventricular refractoriness and restitution curves were estimated from activation recovery intervals (ARIs) calculated from 504 (21 x 24) unipolar electrode recordings 2 mm apart in a plaque sutured to the left ventricular (LV) free wall. A steady-state restitution protocol was performed twice at each of two pacing sites: the LV base and near the left anterior descending artery. VF was electrically induced four times and the incidence of conduction block at each electrode during the first 20 seconds was determined by an automated algorithm. The gradient of the ARI was calculated at each electrode to estimate the spatial dispersion of refractoriness. An exponential curve was fit to the restitution plots of ARIs versus the corresponding diastolic intervals (DIs) for all pacing cycle lengths at each electrode. The locations of epicardial blood vessels were noted after the study. Spatial patterns of conduction block were significantly correlated between the four VF episodes in the same animal (r = 0.66 +/- 0.07, P < 0.05). At the shortest pacing cycle length, the spatial distribution of ARIs, ARI gradients, and restitution slopes was not random but formed clusters of similar values. However, none of these variables was significantly correlated with the incidence of conduction block, even though ARI gradients >2 msec/mm were present between many clusters and approximately 90\% of restitution slopes were >1. Instead, conduction block frequently appeared to cluster along epicardial vessels. CONCLUSION: Neither the dispersion of refractoriness nor action potential duration restitution determined during rapid pacing by itself is the major determinant of the location of conduction block during early VF in normal pigs. It may be that these factors interact synergistically with each other as well as with other factors, including anatomic heterogeneities such as those caused by blood vessels, which may be particularly important for the formation of conduction block and maintenance of VF.},

abstract = {To fully understand the mechanisms of defibrillation, it is critical to know how a given electrical stimulus causes membrane polarizations in cardiac tissue. We have extended the concept of the activating function, originally used to describe neuronal stimulation, to derive a new expression that identifies the sources that drive changes in transmembrane potential. Source terms, or virtual electrodes, consist of either second derivatives of extracellular potential weighted by intracellular conductivity or extracellular potential gradients weighted by derivatives of intracellular conductivity. The full response of passive tissue can be considered, in simple cases, to be a convolution of this "generalized activating function" with the impulse response of the tissue. Computer simulations of a two-dimensional sheet of passive myocardium under steady-state conditions demonstrate that this source term is useful for estimating the effects of applied electrical stimuli. The generalized activating function predicts oppositely polarized regions of tissue when unequally anisotropic tissue is point stimulated and a monopolar response when a point stimulus is applied to isotropic tissue. In the bulk of the myocardium, this new expression is helpful for understanding mechanisms by which virtual electrodes can be produced, such as the hypothetical "sawtooth" pattern of polarization, as well as polarization owing to regions of depressed conductivity, missing cells or clefts, changes in fiber diameter, or fiber curvature. In comparing solutions obtained with an assumed extracellular potential distribution to those with fully coupled intra- and extracellular domains, we find that the former provides a reliable estimate of the total solution. Thus the generalized activating function that we have derived provides a useful way of understanding virtual electrode effects in cardiac tissue.},

abstract = {Sudden cardiac death is a major cause of death in the industrialized world, claiming approximately 300,000 victims annually in the United States alone. In most cases, sudden cardiac death is caused by ventricular fibrillation (VF). Experimental studies in large animal hearts have shown that the uncoordinated contractions during VF are caused by large numbers of chaotically wandering reentrant waves of electrical activity. However, recent clinical data on VF in the human heart seem to suggest that human VF may have a markedly different organization. Here, we use a detailed model of the human ventricles, including a detailed description of cell electrophysiology, ventricular anatomy, and fiber direction anisotropy, to study the organization of human VF. We show that characteristics of our simulated VF are qualitatively similar to the clinical data. Furthermore, we find that human VF is driven by only approximately 10 reentrant sources and thus is much more organized than VF in animal hearts of comparable size, where VF is driven by approximately 50 sources. We investigate the influence of anisotropy ratio, tissue excitability, and restitution properties on the number of reentrant sources driving VF. We find that the number of rotors depends strongest on minimum action potential duration, a property that differs significantly between human and large animal hearts. Based on these findings, we suggest that the simpler spatial organization of human VF relative to VF in large animal hearts may be caused by differences in minimum action potential duration. Both the simpler spatial organization of human VF and its suggested cause may have important implications for treating and preventing this dangerous arrhythmia in humans.},

abstract = {Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the major immediate cause of sudden cardiac death. Traditionally, VF has been defined as turbulent cardiac electrical activity, which implies a large amount of irregularity in the electrical waves that underlie ventricular excitation. During VF, the heart rate is too high (> 550 excitations/minute) to allow adequate pumping of blood. In the electrocardiogram (ECG), ventricular complexes that are ever-changing in frequency, contour, and amplitude characterize VF. This article reviews prevailing theories for the initiation and maintenance of VF, as well as its spatio-temporal organization. Particular attention is given to recent experiments and computer simulations suggesting that VF may be explained in terms of highly periodic three-dimensional rotors that activate the ventricles at exceedingly high frequency. Such rotors may show at least two different behaviors: (a) At one extreme, they may drift throughout the heart at high speeds producing beat-to-beat changes in the activation sequence. (b) At the other extreme, rotors may be relatively stationary, activating the ventricles at such high frequencies that the wave fronts emanating from them breakup at varying distances, resulting in complex spatio-temporal patterns of fibrillatory conduction. In either case, the recorded ECG patterns are indistinguishable from VF. The data discussed have paved the way for a better understanding of the mechanisms of VF in the normal, as well as the diseased, human heart.},

abstract = {Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), together with histology, is widely used to diagnose and to monitor treatment in oncology. Spatial correspondence between these modalities provides information about the ability of MRI to characterize cancerous tissue. However, registration is complicated by deformations during pathological processing, and differences in scale and information content. Methodology/Principal Findings: This study proposes a methodology for establishing an accurate 3D relation between histological sections and high resolution in vivo MRI tumor data. The key features of the methodology are: 1) standardized acquisition and processing, 2) use of an intermediate ex vivo MRI, 3) use of a reference cutting plane, 4) dense histological sampling, 5) elastic registration, and 6) use of complete 3D data sets. Five rat pancreatic tumors imaged by T2-w MRI were used to evaluate the proposed methodology. The registration accuracy was assessed by root mean squared (RMS) distances between manually annotated landmark points in both modalities. After elastic registration the average RMS distance decreased from 1.4 to 0.7 mm. The intermediate ex vivo MRI and the reference cutting plane shared by all three 3D images (in vivo MRI, ex vivo MRI, and 3D histology data) were found to be crucial for the accurate co-registration between the 3D histological data set and in vivo MRI. The MR intensity in necrotic regions, as manually annotated in 3D histology, was significantly different from other histologically confirmed regions (i.e., viable and hemorrhagic). However, the viable and the hemorrhagic regions showed a large overlap in T2-w MRI signal intensity. Conclusions: The established 3D correspondence between tumor histology and in vivo MRI enables extraction of MRI characteristics for histologically confirmed regions. The proposed methodology allows the creation of a tumor database of spatially registered multi-spectral MR images and multi-stained 3D histology.},

abstract = {It has been shown by histology that cardiac myocytes are organized into laminae and this structure is important in function, both influencing the spread of electrical activation and enabling myocardial thickening in systole by laminar sliding. We have carried out high-spatial resolution three-dimensional MRI of the ventricular myolaminae of the entire volume of the isolated rat heart after contrast perfusion [dimeglumine gadopentate (Gd-DTPA)]. Four ex vivo rat hearts were perfused with Gd-DTPA and fixative and high-spatial resolution MRI was performed on a 9.4T MRI system. After MRI, cryosectioning followed by histology was performed. Images from MRI and histology were aligned, described, and quantitatively compared. In the three-dimensional MR images we directly show the presence of laminae and demonstrate that these are highly branching and are absent from much of the subepicardium. We visualized these MRI volumes to demonstrate laminar architecture and quantitatively demonstrated that the structural features observed are similar to those imaged in histology. We showed qualitatively and quantitatively that laminar architecture is similar in the four hearts. MRI can be used to image the laminar architecture of ex vivo hearts in three dimensions, and the images produced are qualitatively and quantitatively comparable with histology. We have demonstrated in the rat that: 1) laminar architecture is consistent between hearts; 2) myolaminae are absent from much of the subepicardium; and 3) although localized orthotropy is present throughout the myocardium, tracked myolaminae are branching structures and do not have a discrete identity.},

abstract = {Structural remodeling of the myocardium associated with mechanical overload or cardiac infarction is accompanied by the appearance of myofibroblasts. These fibroblast-like cells express alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA) and have been shown to express connexins in tissues other than heart. The present study examined whether myofibroblasts of cardiac origin establish heterocellular gap junctional coupling with cardiomyocytes and whether ensuing electrotonic interactions affect impulse propagation. For this purpose, impulse conduction characteristics (conduction velocity [theta] and maximal upstroke velocity [dV/dt(max)]) were assessed optically in cultured strands of cardiomyocytes, which were coated with fibroblasts of cardiac origin. Immunocytochemistry showed that cultured fibroblasts underwent a phenotype switch to alpha SMA-positive myofibroblasts that expressed connexin 43 and 45 both among themselves and at contact sites with cardiomyocytes. Myofibroblasts affected theta and dV/dt(max) in a cell density-dependent manner; a gradual increase of myofibroblast-to-cardiomyocyte ratios up to 7:100 caused an increase of both theta and dV/dt(max), which was followed by a progressive decline at higher ratios. On full coverage of the strands with myofibroblasts (ratio > 20:100), theta fell < 200 mm/s. This biphasic dependence of theta and dV/dt(max) on myofibroblast density is reminiscent of "supernormal conduction" and is explained by a myofibroblast density-dependent gradual depolarization of the cardiomyocyte strands from -78 mV to -50 mV as measured using microelectrode recordings. These findings suggest that myofibroblasts, apart from their role in structural remodeling, might contribute to arrhythmogenesis by direct electrotonic modulation of conduction and that prevention of their appearance might represent an antiarrhythmic therapeutic target.},

@article{Rudy2006,
abstract = {The cardiac cell is a complex biological system where various processes interact to generate electrical excitation (the action potential, AP) and contraction. During AP generation, membrane ion channels interact nonlinearly with dynamically changing ionic concentrations and varying transmembrane voltage, and are subject to regulatory processes. In recent years, a large body of knowledge has accumulated on the molecular structure of cardiac ion channels, their function, and their modification by genetic mutations that are associated with cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death. However, ion channels are typically studied in isolation (in expression systems or isolated membrane patches), away from the physiological environment of the cell where they interact to generate the AP. A major challenge remains the integration of ion-channel properties into the functioning, complex and highly interactive cell system, with the objective to relate molecular-level processes and their modification by disease to whole-cell function and clinical phenotype. In this article we describe how computational biology can be used to achieve such integration. We explain how mathematical (Markov) models of ion-channel kinetics are incorporated into integrated models of cardiac cells to compute the AP. We provide examples of mathematical (computer) simulations of physiological and pathological phenomena, including AP adaptation to changes in heart rate, genetic mutations in SCN5A and HERG genes that are associated with fatal cardiac arrhythmias, and effects of the CaMKII regulatory pathway and beta-adrenergic cascade on the cell electrophysiological function.},

abstract = {Recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technology have unveiled a wealth of information regarding cardiac histoanatomical complexity. However, methods to faithfully translate this level of fine-scale structural detail into computational whole ventricular models are still in their infancy, and, thus, the relevance of this additional complexity for simulations of cardiac function has yet to be elucidated. Here, we describe the development of a highly detailed finite-element computational model (resolution: approximately 125 microm) of rabbit ventricles constructed from high-resolution MR data (raw data resolution: 43 x 43 x 36 microm), including the processes of segmentation (using a combination of level-set approaches), identification of relevant anatomical features, mesh generation, and myocyte orientation representation (using a rule-based approach). Full access is provided to the completed model and MR data. Simulation results were compared with those from a simplified model built from the same images but excluding finer anatomical features (vessels/endocardial structures). Initial simulations showed that the presence of trabeculations can provide shortcut paths for excitation, causing regional differences in activation after pacing between models. Endocardial structures gave rise to small-scale virtual electrodes upon the application of external field stimulation, which appeared to protect parts of the endocardium in the complex model from strong polarizations, whereas intramural virtual electrodes caused by blood vessels and extracellular cleft spaces appeared to reduce polarization of the epicardium. Postshock, these differences resulted in the genesis of new excitation wavefronts that were not observed in more simplified models. Furthermore, global differences in the stimulus recovery rates of apex/base regions were observed, causing differences in the ensuing arrhythmogenic episodes. In conclusion, structurally simplified models are well suited for a large range of cardiac modeling applications. However, important differences are seen when behavior at microscales is relevant, particularly when examining the effects of external electrical stimulation on tissue electrophysiology and arrhythmia induction. This highlights the utility of histoanatomically detailed models for investigations of cardiac function, in particular for future patient-specific modeling.},

We note that the quality of a reconstructed volume is usually assessed by considering the smoothness of some reconstructed structures of interest (e.g., the gray-white matter surfaces in brain images). Here we propose to use smoothness as a means to drive the reconstruction process itself. From a pair-wise rigid reconstruction of the 2-D slices, we first extract the boundaries of structures of interest. Those are then smoothed with a min-max curvature flow confined to the 2-D planes in which the slices lie. Finally, for each slice, we estimate a linear or flexible transformation from the sparse displacement field computed from the flow, which we apply to the original 2-D slices to obtain a smooth volume. In addition, we present a co-occurrence matrix-based technique to quantify the smoothness of reconstructed volumes. We discuss and validate the application of both our reconstruction approach and the smoothness measure on synthetic examples as well as real histological data.},

abstract = {Many drugs fail in the clinical trials and therefore do not reach the market due to adverse effects on cardiac electrical function. This represents a growing concern for both regulatory and pharmaceutical agencies as it translates into important socio-economic costs. Drugs affecting cardiac activity come from diverse pharmacological groups and their interaction with cardiac electrophysiology can result in increased risk of potentially life threatening arrhythmias, such as Torsade de Pointes. The mechanisms of drug interaction with the heart are very complex and the effects span from the ion channel to the whole organ level. This makes their investigation using solely experimental in vitro and in vivo techniques very difficult. Computational modelling of cardiac electrophysiological behaviour has provided insight into the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmogenesis, with high spatio-temporal resolution, from the ion channel to the whole organ level. It therefore represents a powerful tool in investigating mechanisms of drug-induced changes in cardiac behaviour and in their pro-arrhythmic potential.

Using the model, the study aims to provide quantification of fluorescent signal distortion for different optical characteristics of the preparation and of the surrounding medium. A bi-domain representation of electrical activity is combined with finite element solutions to the photon diffusion equation simulating both the excitation and emission processes, along with physically realistic boundary conditions at the epicardium, which allow simulation of different experimental setups. We demonstrate that distortion in the optical signal as a result of fluorescent photon scattering is truly a three-dimensional phenomenon and depends critically upon the geometry of the preparation, the scattering properties of the tissue, the direction of wavefront propagation, and the specifics of the experimental setup. Importantly, we show that in an anatomically accurate model of ventricular geometry and fiber orientation, the morphology of the optical signal does not provide reliable information regarding the intramural direction of wavefront propagation. These findings underscore the potential of the new model in interpreting experimental data.},

abstract = {The ability to perform fast, accurate, high-resolution visualization is fundamental to improving our understanding of anatomical data. As the volumes of data increase from improvements in scanning technology, the methods applied to visualization must evolve. In this paper, we address the interactive display of data from high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scanning of a rabbit heart and subsequent histological imaging. We describe a visualization environment involving a tiled liquid crystal display panel display wall and associated software, which provides an interactive and intuitive user interface. The oView software is an OpenGL application that is written for the VR Juggler environment. This environment abstracts displays and devices away from the application itself, aiding portability between different systems, from desktop PCs to multi-tiled display walls. Portability between display walls has been demonstrated through its use on walls at the universities of both Leeds and Oxford. We discuss important factors to be considered for interactive two-dimensional display of large three-dimensional datasets, including the use of intuitive input devices and level of detail aspects.},

Of the 2,800 entries in PubMed with "Systems Biology" in either the title or the abstract, only two papers were published before 2000, and >90\% were published in the past five years. In this article, we interpret Systems Biology as an approach rather than as a field or a destination of research. We illustrate that this approach is productive for the exploration of systems behavior, or "phenotypes," at all levels of structural and functional complexity, explicitly including the supracellular domain, and suggest how this may be related conceptually to genomes and biochemical networks. We discuss the role of models in Systems Biology and conclude with a consideration of their utility in biomedical research and development.},

The algorithm uses the fixed Langrangian reference frame to define the map between coordinate systems, but also generates and stores the inverse map from the Eulerian to the Lagrangian frame. Computing both maps allows facile computation of both Eulerian and Langrangian quantities. We apply this algorithm to estimating a putative evolutionary change of coordinates between a population of chimpanzee and human cortices. Inter-species functional homologues fix the map explicitly, where they are known, while image similarities guide the alignment elsewhere. This map allows detailed study of the volumetric change between chimp and human cortex. Instead of basing the inter-species study on a single species atlas, we diffeomorphically connect the mean shape and intensity templates for each group. The human statistics then map diffeomorphically into the space of the chimpanzee cortex providing a comparison between species. The population statistics show a significant doubling of the relative prefrontal lobe size in humans, as compared to chimpanzees.},

abstract = {Investigating the mechanisms underlying the genesis and conduction of electrical excitation in the atria at physiological and pathological states is of great importance. To provide knowledge concerning the mechanisms of excitation, we constructed a biophysical detailed and anatomically accurate computer model of human atria that incorporates both structural and electrophysiological heterogeneities. The three-dimensional geometry was extracted from the visible female dataset. The sinoatrial node (SAN) and atrium, including crista terminalis (CT), pectinate muscles (PM), appendages (APG) and Bachmann's bundle (BB) were segmented in this work. Fibre orientation in CT, PM and BB was set to local longitudinal direction. Descriptions for all used cell types were based on modifications of the Courtemanche et al. model of a human atrial cell. Maximum conductances of Ito, IKr and ICa,L were modified for PM, CT, APG and atrioventricular ring to reproduce measured action potentials (AP). Pacemaker activity in the human SAN was reproduced by removing IK1, but including If, ICa,T, and gradients of channel conductances as described in previous studies for heterogeneous rabbit SAN. Anisotropic conduction was computed with a monodomain model using the finite element method. The transversal to longitudinal ratio of conductivity for PM, CT and BB was 1:9. Atrial working myocardium (AWM) was set to be isotropic. Simulation of atrial electrophysiology showed initiation of APs in the SAN centre. The excitation spread afterwards to the periphery near to the region of the CT and preferentially towards the atrioventricular region. The excitation extends over the right atrium along PM. Both CT and PM activated the right AWM. Earliest activation of the left atrium was through BB and excitation spread over to the APG. The conduction velocities were 0.6ms-1 for AWM, 1.2ms-1 for CT, 1.6ms-1 for PM and 1.1ms-1 for BB at a rate of 63bpm. The simulations revealed that bundles form dominant pathways for atrial conduction. The preferential conduction towards CT and along PM is comparable with clinical mapping. Repolarization is more homogeneous than excitation due to the heterogeneous distribution of electrophysiological properties and hence the action potential duration.},

abstract = {Fine-scale anatomical structures in the heart may play an important role in sustaining cardiac arrhythmias. However, the extent of this role, and how it may differ between species, is not fully understood. In this study, we used computational modelling to assess the impact of anatomy upon arrhythmia maintenance in the rabbit ventricles. Specifically, we quantified the dynamics of excitation wavefronts during episodes of simulated tachyarrhythmias and fibrillatory arrhythmias, defined as being respectively characterised by relatively low / high spatio-temporal disorganisation. Two computational models were used: a highly anatomically-detailed MR-derived rabbit ventricular model (representing vasculature, endocardial structures) and a simplified equivalent model, constructed from the same MR-data but lacking such fine-scale anatomical features. During tachyarrhythmias, anatomically-complex and simplified models showed very similar dynamics; however, during fibrillatory arrhythmias, as activation wavelength decreased, the presence of fine-scale anatomical details appeared to marginally increase disorganisation of wavefronts during arrhythmias in the complex model. Although a small amount of clustering of reentrant rotor centres (ﬁlaments) around endocardial structures was witnessed in follow-up analysis (which slightly increased during fibrillation as rotor size decreased), this was significantly less than previously reported in large animals. Importantly, no anchoring of reentrant rotors was visibly identifiable in arrhythmia movies. These differences between tachy- and fibrillatory arrhythmias suggest that the relative size of reentrant rotors with respect to anatomical obstacles governs the influence of fine-scale anatomy in the maintenance of ventricular arrhythmias in the rabbit. In conclusion, our simulations suggest that fine-scale anatomical features play little apparent role in the maintenance of tachyarrhythmias in the rabbit ventricles and, contrary to experimental reports in larger animals, appear to play only a minor role in the maintenance of fibrillatory arrhythmias. These findings also have important implications in optimising the level of detail required in anatomical computational meshes frequently used in arrhythmia investigations.},

We then provide a detailed explanation of a processing pipeline which we have recently developed for constructing realistic computational models of the heart from high resolution structural and diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired ex vivo. The presentation of the pipeline incorporates a review of the methodologies that can be used to reconstruct models of cardiac structure. In this pipeline, the structural image is segmented to reconstruct the ventricles, normal myocardium, and infarct. A finite element mesh is generated from the segmented structural image, and fiber orientations are assigned to the elements based on DTMR data. The methods were applied to construct seven different models of healthy and diseased hearts. These models contain millions of elements, with spatial resolutions in the order of hundreds of microns, providing unprecedented detail in the representation of cardiac structure for simulation studies.},

abstract = {High-energy defibrillation shock is the only therapy for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, because of adverse side effects, lowering defibrillation energy is desirable. We investigated mechanisms of unpinning, destabilization, and termination of ventricular tachycardia (VT) by low-energy shocks in isolated rabbit right ventricular preparations (n = 22). Stable VT was initiated with burst pacing and was optically mapped. Monophasic "unpinning" shocks (10 ms) of different strengths were applied at various phases throughout the reentry cycle. In 8 of 22 preparations, antitachycardia pacing (ATP: 8-20 pulses, 50-105\% of period, 0.8-10 mA) was also applied. Termination of reentry by ATP was achieved in only 5 of 8 preparations. Termination by unpinning occurred in all 22 preparations. Rayleigh's test showed a statistically significant unpinning phase window, during which reentry could be unpinned and subsequently terminated with E80 (magnitude at which 80\% of reentries were unpinned) = 1.2 V/cm. All reentries were unpinned with field strengths < or = 2.4 V/cm. Unpinning was achieved by inducing virtual electrode polarization and secondary sources of excitation at the core of reentry. Optical mapping revealed the mechanisms of phase-dependent unpinning of reentry. These results suggest that a 20-fold reduction in energy could be achieved compared with conventional high-energy defibrillation and that the unpinning method may be more effective than ATP for terminating stable, pinned reentry in this experimental model.},

It describes patterns for managing object creation, composing objects into larger structures, and coordinating control flow between objects. The book provides numerous examples where using composition rather than inheritance can improve the reusability and flexibility of code. Note, though, that it's not a tutorial but a catalog that you can use to find an object-oriented design pattern that's appropriate for the needs of your particular application-a selection for virtuoso programmers who appreciate (or require) consistent, well-engineered object-oriented designs. Now on CD, this internationally acclaimed bestseller is more valuable than ever! Use the contents of the CD to create your own design documents and reusable components. The CD contains: 23 patterns you can cut and paste into your own design documents; sample code demonstrating pattern implementation; complete Design Patterns content in standard HTML format, with numerous hyperlinked cross-references; accessed through a standard web browser; Java-based dynamic search mechanism, enhancing online seach capabilities; graphical user environment, allowing ease of navigation. First published in 1995, this landmark work on object-oriented software design presents a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to common design problems. Created by four experienced designers, the 23 patterns contained herein have become an essential resource for anyone developing reusable object-oriented software. In response to reader demand, the complete text and pattern catalog are now available on CD-ROM. This electronic version of Design Patterns enables programmers to install the book directly onto a computer or network for use as an online reference for creating reusable object-oriented software. The authors first describe what patterns are and how they can help you in the design process. They then systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. All patterns are compiled from real-world examples and include code that demonstrates how they may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages such as C++ and Smalltalk. Readers who already own the book will want the CD to take advantage of its dynamic search mechanism and ready-to-install patterns.},

abstract = {Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a possible new means of elucidating the anatomic structure of the myocardium. It enjoys several advantages over traditional histological approaches, including the ability to rapidly measure fiber organization in isolated, perfused, arrested hearts, thereby avoiding fixation and sectioning of artifacts. However, quantitative validation of this MRI method has been lacking. Here, fiber orientations estimated in the same locations in the same heart using both diffusion tensor MRI and histology are compared in a total of two perfused rabbit hearts. Fiber orientations were statistically similar for both methods and differed on average by 12 degrees at any single location. This is similar to the 10 degrees uncertainty in fiber orientation achieved with histology. In addition, imaging studies performed in a total of seven hearts support a level of organization beyond the myofiber, the recently described laminar organization of the ventricular myocardium.},

Tomographic imaging methods offer automatically aligned and calibrated volumetric images, but the usefulness of X-ray CT imaging for developmental biology has been limited by the low inherent contrast of embryonic tissues. Here, I demonstrate simple staining methods that allow high-contrast imaging of embryonic tissues at histological resolutions using a commercial microCT system. Quantitative comparisons of images of chick embryos treated with different contrast agents show that three very simple methods using inorganic iodine and phosphotungstic acid produce overall contrast and differential tissue contrast for X-ray imaging at least as high as that obtained with osmium. The stains can be used after any common fixation and after storage in aqueous or alcoholic media, and on a wide variety of species. These methods establish microCT imaging as a useful tool for comparative developmental studies, embryo phenotyping, and quantitative modeling of development.},

abstract = {Cardiac architecture is inherently three-dimensional, yet most characterizations rely on two-dimensional histological slices or dissociated cells, which remove the native geometry of the heart. We previously developed a method for labeling intact heart sections without dissociation and imaging large volumes while preserving their three-dimensional structure. We further refine this method to permit quantitative analysis of imaged sections. After data acquisition, these sections are assembled using image-processing tools, and qualitative and quantitative information is extracted. By examining the reconstructed cardiac blocks, one can observe end-to-end adjacent cardiac myocytes (cardiac strands) changing cross-sectional geometries, merging and separating from other strands. Quantitatively, representative cross-sectional areas typically used for determining hypertrophy omit the three-dimensional component; we show that taking orientation into account can significantly alter the analysis. Using fast-Fourier transform analysis, we analyze the gross organization of cardiac strands in three dimensions. By characterizing cardiac structure in three dimensions, we are able to determine that the alpha crystallin mutation leads to hypertrophy with cross-sectional area increases, but not necessarily via changes in fiber orientation distribution.},

@article{Anderson2009,
abstract = {The arrangement of the myocytes aggregated together within the ventricular walls has been the subject of anatomic investigation for more than four centuries. The dangers of analyzing the myocardium on the basis of arrangement of the skeletal myocytes have long been appreciated, yet some still described the ventricular myocardium in terms of a unique band extending from the pulmonary trunk to the aorta. Another current interpretation, with much support, is that the ventricular myocytes are compartmentalized in the form of sheets, albeit that the extent of division, and interrelations, of the sheets is less well explained. Histological examination, however, shows that the only muscular unit to be found within the myocardial walls is the cardiac myocyte itself. Our own investigations show that, rather than forming a continuous band, or being arranged as sheets, the myocytes are aggregated together as a three-dimensional mesh within a supporting matrix of fibrous tissue. Within the mesh of aggregated myocytes, it is then possible to recognize two populations, depending on the orientations of their long axes. The first population is aligned with the long axis of the aggregated myocytes tangential to the epicardial and endocardial borders, albeit with marked variation in the angulation relative to the ventricular equator. Correlation with measurements taken using force probes shows that these myocytes produce the major unloading of the blood during ventricular systole. The second population is aligned at angles of up to 40 degrees from the epicardium toward the endocardium. The correlation with measurements from force probes reveals that these intruding myocytes produce auxotonic forces during the cardiac cycle. The three-dimensional arrangement of the mesh also serves to account for the realignment of the myocytes that must take place during ventricular contraction so as to account for the extent of systolic mural thickening.},

However, no currently available detailed action potential model accurately reproduces the dynamics of the cardiac action potential and intracellular calcium (Ca(i)) cycling at rapid heart rates relevant to ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The aim of this study was to develop such a model. Using an existing rabbit ventricular action potential model, we modified the L-type calcium (Ca) current (I(Ca,L)) and Ca(i) cycling formulations based on new experimental patch-clamp data obtained in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes, using the perforated patch configuration at 35-37 degrees C. Incorporating a minimal seven-state Markovian model of I(Ca,L) that reproduced Ca- and voltage-dependent kinetics in combination with our previously published dynamic Ca(i) cycling model, the new model replicates experimentally observed action potential duration and Ca(i) transient alternans at rapid heart rates, and accurately reproduces experimental action potential duration restitution curves obtained by either dynamic or S1S2 pacing.},

abstract = {Polarised light imaging (PLI) utilises the birefringence of the myelin sheaths in order to visualise the orientation of nerve fibres in microtome sections of adult human post-mortem brains at ultra-high spatial resolution. The preparation of post-mortem brains for PLI involves fixation, freezing and cutting into 100-mum-thick sections. Hence, geometrical distortions of histological sections are inevitable and have to be removed for 3D reconstruction and subsequent fibre tracking. We here present a processing pipeline for 3D reconstruction of these sections using PLI derived multimodal images of post-mortem brains. Blockface images of the brains were obtained during cutting; they serve as reference data for alignment and elimination of distortion artefacts. In addition to the spatial image transformation, fibre orientation vectors were reoriented using the transformation fields, which consider both affine and subsequent non-linear registration. The application of this registration and reorientation approach results in a smooth fibre vector field, which reflects brain morphology. PLI combined with 3D reconstruction and fibre tracking is a powerful tool for human brain mapping. It can also serve as an independent method for evaluating in vivo fibre tractography.},

Several opposing and non-mutually compatible models have been proposed to explain cardiac structure, and these models, although limited, have advanced the study and understanding of heart structure, function and development. We describe key areas of similarity and difference, highlight areas of contention and point to the important limitations of these models. Recent research in animal models on the nature, geometry and interaction of cardiac sheet structure allows unification of some seemingly conflicting features of the structural models. Intriguingly, evidence points to significant inter-individual structural variability (within constrained limits) in the canine, leading to the concept of a continuum (or distribution) of cardiac structures. This variability in heart structure partly explains the ongoing debate on myocardial architecture. These developments are used to construct an integrated description of cardiac structure unifying features of fibre, sheet and band architecture that provides a basis for (i) explaining cardiac electromechanics, (ii) computational simulations of cardiac physiology and (iii) designing interventions.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study examines the consequences of a large transmural apical infarct on the epicardial electrical activity in isolated rabbit hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hearts were isolated 8 weeks after coronary artery ligation. Membrane voltage from the epicardial surface of the left ventricle (LV) including the infarct was monitored using the voltage sensitive dye RH237. Optical action potentials were detected from the epicardial surface of the infarct; the signal amplitude was approximately 20\% of those in the noninfarcted zone (NZ). Epicardial activation mapping of the LV free wall showed that during right atrial (RA) pacing, the activation sequence was not significantly different between infarcted and sham-operated groups. However, direct stimulation of the epicardium in the NZ revealed an area of slow conduction velocity (CV approximately 5 cm/s(-1), approximately 10\% of normal values) at the margin of the infarct zone (IZ). Within the IZ, CV was approximately 50\% of normal. A prominent endocardial rim of myocardium in the infarct was not the source of epicardial optical signals because chemical ablation of the endocardium did not affect the epicardial activation pattern. CONCLUSION: Therefore, remnant groups of myocytes in the mid-wall and epicardium of the infarct scar support normal electrical activation during RA pacing. Areas of delayed conduction emerge only on epicardial stimulation.},

Genetic studies in the mouse have been crucial to uncover new genes and signaling pathways associated with heart development and congenital heart disease. The identification of murine models of congenital cardiac malformations in high-throughput mutagenesis screens and in gene-targeted models is hindered by the opacity of the mouse embryo. RESULTS: We developed and optimized a novel method for high-throughput multi-embryo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using this approach we identified cardiac malformations in phosphatidylserine receptor (Ptdsr) deficient embryos. These included ventricular septal defects, double-outlet right ventricle, and hypoplasia of the pulmonary artery and thymus. These results indicate that Ptdsr plays a key role in cardiac development. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel multi-embryo MRI technique enables high-throughput identification of murine models for human congenital cardiopulmonary malformations at high spatial resolution. The technique can be easily adapted for mouse mutagenesis screens and, thus provides an important new tool for identifying new mouse models for human congenital heart diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Aging is associated with a significant increase in atrial tachyarrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation. A macroscopic repolarization gradient created artificially by a stimulus at one site before a premature stimulus from a second site is widely considered to be part of the experimental protocol necessary for the initiation of such arrhythmias in the Laboratory. How such gradients occur naturally in aging atrial tissue is unknown.OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine if the pattern of cellular connectivity in aging human atrial bundles produces a mechanism for variable early premature responses.METHODS Extracellular and intracellular potentials were recorded after control and premature stimuli at a single site in aging human atrial bundles. We also measured cellular geometry, the distribution of connexins, and the distribution of collagenous septa. A model of the atrial bundles was constructed based on the morphological results. Action potential propagation and the sodium current were analyzed after premature stimuli in the model.RESULTS Similar extracellular potential waveform responses occurred after early premature stimuli in the aging bundles and in the model. Variable premature conduction patterns were accounted for by the single model of aging atrial structure. A major feature of the model results was that the conduction events and the magnitude of the sodium current at multiple sites were very sensitive to small changes in the location and the timing of premature stimuli.CONCLUSION In aging human atrial bundles stimulated from only a single site, premature stimuli induce variable arrhythmogenic conduction responses. The generation of these responses is greatly enhanced by remodeling of cellular connectivity during aging. The results provide insight into sodium current structural interactions as a general mechanism of arrhythmogenic atrial responses to premature stimuli.},

abstract = {We present a novel algorithm for the registration of 2D image sequences that combines the principles of multiresolution B-spline-based elastic registration and those of bidirectional consistent registration. In our method, consecutive triples of images are iteratively registered to gradually extend the information through the set of images of the entire sequence. The intermediate results are reused for the registration of the following triple. We choose to interpolate the images and model the deformation fields using B-spline multiresolution pyramids. Novel boundary conditions are introduced to better characterize the deformations at the boundaries. In the experimental section, we quantitatively show that our method recovers from barrel/pincushion and fish-eye deformations with subpixel error. Moreover, it is more robust against outliers--occasional strong noise and large rotations--than the state-of-the-art methods. Finally, we show that our method can be used to realign series of histological serial sections, which are often heavily distorted due to folding and tearing of the tissues.},

The complexity and integrative nature of heart cell electrophysiology and Ca²(+) cycling has led to an evolution of computational models that have played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of heart function. An important emerging theme in systems biology is that the detailed nature of local signaling events, such as those that occur in the cardiac dyad, have important consequences at higher biological scales. Multiscale modeling techniques have revealed many mechanistic links between microscale events, such as Ca²(+) binding to a channel protein, and macroscale phenomena, such as excitation-contraction coupling gain.

abstract = {Computational models in physiology often integrate functional and structural information from a large range of spatiotemporal scales from the ionic to the whole organ level. Their sophistication raises both expectations and skepticism concerning how computational methods can improve our understanding of living organisms and also how they can reduce, replace, and refine animal experiments. A fundamental requirement to fulfill these expectations and achieve the full potential of computational physiology is a clear understanding of what models represent and how they can be validated. The present study aims at informing strategies for validation by elucidating the complex interrelations among experiments, models, and simulations in cardiac electrophysiology. We describe the processes, data, and knowledge involved in the construction of whole ventricular multiscale models of cardiac electrophysiology. Our analysis reveals that models, simulations, and experiments are intertwined, in an assemblage that is a system itself, namely the model-simulation-experiment (MSE) system. We argue that validation is part of the whole MSE system and is contingent upon 1) understanding and coping with sources of biovariability; 2) testing and developing robust techniques and tools as a prerequisite to conducting physiological investigations; 3) defining and adopting standards to facilitate the interoperability of experiments, models, and simulations; 4) and understanding physiological validation as an iterative process that contributes to defining the specific aspects of cardiac electrophysiology the MSE system targets, rather than being only an external test, and that this is driven by advances in experimental and computational methods and the combination of both.},

abstract = {AIMS: Existence of myocyte-fibroblast coupling in the human heart is still a controversial question. This study aims at investigating in a biophysical model how much coupling would be necessary to perturb significantly the electrical propagation of the cardiac impulse. METHODS AND RESULTS: A one-dimensional model representing a strand of myocytes covered by a layer of fibroblasts was formulated by reinterpreting the coupled myocyte-fibroblast system as a single unit and connecting these units using a monodomain approach. The myocyte membrane kinetics was described by the Bondarenko mouse cell model and the fibroblast response was based on an experimentally measured current-voltage curve and took into account the delayed activation of that current. Conduction and maximal upstroke velocities were reported for different fibroblast densities and myocyte-fibroblast coupling strengths during paced rhythm. A reduction in conduction and maximum upstroke velocities was observed for increasing coupling and fibroblast density, in agreement with cell culture experiments. This effect was because of an increase in the myocyte resting potential and of the fibroblasts acting as a current sink. At least 10 fibroblasts with capacitance 4.5 pF had to be connected to each myocyte with capacitance 153.4 pF to slow down the conduction by >10\%. CONCLUSION: Coupling with fibroblasts affects the myocyte resting potential and the impulse propagation, but microstructural changes and myocyte decoupling are needed to explain slow conduction in fibrotic tissue.},

@article{Xie2009,
annote = {The distribution of ventricular cell and tissue types is important in the initiation and maintenance of arrhythmia. For example, fibroblasts alter conduction velocity and refractoriness through several mechanisms. Traditionally, only cardiomyocyte decoupling was considered important, where fibroblasts act as passive insulating barriers, creating convoluted ‘zigzag’ conduction pathways and retarding propagation (3, 4). Recent experimental studies have documented that functional gap junctions form between fibroblasts and myocytes (8, 9, 10). Gap junctions affect propagation in three main ways.  Firstly, the conductivity facilitated by the junctions enhances propagation, allowing fibroblasts to transduce activation between otherwise unconnected myocytes (6, 14). Secondly and contrastingly, the junctions cause electrotonic loading; fibroblasts act as capacitors coupled to the myocytes, absorbing ionic currents and delaying myocyte activation (18, Xie). Finally, the coupling elevates myocyte resting membrane potential, causing conduction velocity first to increase and then to decrease with increasing fibroblast concentration and/or gap junction conductance, until finally conduction failure occurs (13, Xie). Fibroblasts also modulate myocyte behaviour via the release of paracrine factors [Cardiac fibroblast paracrine factors alter impulse conduction and ion channel expression of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Cardiovascular Research 2009;83:688–697]. A recent computational study $\backslash$cite\{Xie:2009\} suggests that this mechanism adds to the range, complexity and significance of the two cell types' mutual interaction, whilst conceding: "A second major limitation relates to simulating laminar sheet structures using a 2D model, which may obscure potentially important 3D transfiber effects of the laminar clefts. A real 3D structure is needed for further study, ideally modeled on a realistic representation of 3D cell distribution and coupling."},

This paper evaluated the T-waves for different previously measured heterogeneous ion channel distributions. To this end, cardiac activation and repolarization was simulated on a high resolution and anisotropic biventricular model of a volunteer. From the same volunteer, multichannel ECG data were obtained. Resulting transmembrane voltage distributions for the previously measured heterogeneous ion channel expressions were used to calculate the ECG and the simulated T-wave was compared to the measured ECG for quantitative evaluation. Both exclusively transmural (TM) and exclusively apico-basal (AB) setups produced concordant T-waves, whereas interventricular (IV) heterogeneities led to notched T-wave morphologies. The best match with the measured T-wave was achieved for a purely AB setup with shorter apical APD and a mix of AB and TM heterogeneity with M-cells in midmyocardial position and shorter apical APD. Finally, we probed two configurations in which the APD was negatively correlated with the activation time. In one case, this meant that the repolarization directly followed the sequence of activation. Still, the associated T-waves were concordant albeit of low amplitude.},

abstract = {The general anatomy of the cardiac conduction system (CCS) has been known for 100 years, but its complex and irregular three-dimensional (3D) geometry is not so well understood. This is largely because the conducting tissue is not distinct from the surrounding tissue by dissection. The best descriptions of its anatomy come from studies based on serial sectioning of samples taken from the appropriate areas of the heart. Low X-ray attenuation has formerly ruled out micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) as a modality to resolve internal structures of soft tissue, but incorporation of iodine, which has a high molecular weight, into those tissues enhances the differential attenuation of X-rays and allows visualisation of fine detail in embryos and skeletal muscle. Here, with the use of a iodine based contrast agent (I(2)KI), we present contrast enhanced micro-CT images of cardiac tissue from rat and rabbit in which the three major subdivisions of the CCS can be differentiated from the surrounding contractile myocardium and visualised in 3D. Structures identified include the sinoatrial node (SAN) and the atrioventricular conduction axis: the penetrating bundle, His bundle, the bundle branches and the Purkinje network. Although the current findings are consistent with existing anatomical representations, the representations shown here offer superior resolution and are the first 3D representations of the CCS within a single intact mammalian heart.},

@article{Li2009,
abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of small animals is routinely performed in research centers. But despite its many advantages, MR still suffers from limited spatial resolution which makes the interpretation and quantitative analysis of the images difficult, particularly for small structures of interest within areas of significant heterogeneity. One possibility to address this issue is to complement the MR images with histological data, which requires reconstructing 3D volumes from a series of 2D images. A number of methods have been proposed recently in the literature to address this issue, but deformation or tearing during the slicing process often produces reconstructed volumes with visible artifacts and imperfections. In this paper, we show that a possible solution to this problem is to work with several histological volumes, reconstruct each of these separately and then compute an average. The resulting histological atlas shows structures and substructures more clearly than any individual volume. We also propose an original approach to normalize intensity values across slices, a required preprocessing step when reconstructing histological volumes. We show that the histological atlas we have created can be used to localize structures and substructures, which cannot be seen easily in MR images. We also create an MR atlas that is associated with the histological atlas. We show that using the histological volumes to create the MR atlas is better than using the MR volumes only. Finally, we validate our approach quantitatively on MR image volumes by comparing volumetric measurements obtained manually and obtained automatically with our atlases.},

@article{Atkinson2011,
abstract = {Functioning of the cardiac conduction system depends critically on its structure and its complement of ion channels. Therefore, the aim of this study was to document both the structure and ion channel expression of the left and right ventricular His-Purkinje networks, as we have previously done for the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. A three-dimensional (3D) anatomical computer model of the His-Purkinje network of the rabbit heart was constructed after staining the network by immunoenzyme labelling of a marker protein, middle neurofilament. The bundle of His is a ribbon-like structure and the architecture of the His-Purkinje network differs between the left and right ventricles. The 3D model is able to explain the breakthrough points of the action potential on the ventricular epicardium during sinus rhythm. Using quantitative PCR, the expression levels of the major ion channels were measured in the free running left and right Purkinje fibres of the rabbit heart. Expression of ion channels differs from that of the working myocardium and can explain the specialised electrical activity of the Purkinje fibres as suggested by computer simulations; the expression profile of the left Purkinje fibres is more specialised than that of the right Purkinje fibres. The structure and ion channel expression of the Purkinje fibres are highly specialised and tailored to the functioning of the system. The His-Purkinje network in the left ventricle is more developed than that in the right ventricle and this may explain its greater clinical importance.},

The toolkit concentrates on 3D medical data segmentation and registration algorithms, multimodal and multiresolution capabilities, and portable platform independent support for Windows, Linux/Unix systems. This toolkit was built using current practices in software engineering. Specifically, we embraced the concept of generic programming during the development of these tools, working extensively with C++ templates and the freedom and flexibility they allow.

abstract = {Cardiac histo-anatomical structure is a key determinant in all aspects of cardiac function. While some characteristics of micro- and macrostructure can be quantified using non-invasive imaging methods, histology is still the modality that provides the best combination of resolution and identification of cellular/sub-cellular substrate identities. The main limitation of histology is that it does not provide inherently consistent three-dimensional (3D) volume repre- sentations. This paper presents methods developed within our group to recon- struct 3D histological datasets. It includes the use of high-resolution MRI and block-face images to provide supporting volumetric datasets to guide spatial reintegration of 2D histological section data, and presents recent developments in sample preparation, data acquisition, and image processing.},

The current state of the art is reviewed, and its limitations are discussed. We assess the challenges associated with the generation of histo-anatomically representative individualized in silico models of the heart. The entire processing pipeline including image acquisition, image processing, mesh generation, model set-up and execution of computer simulations, and the underlying methods are described. The multifaceted challenges associated with these goals are highlighted, suitable solutions are proposed, and an important application of developed high-resolution structure-function models in elucidating the effect of individual structural heterogeneity upon wavefront dynamics is demonstrated.},
