abstract = {Computations on tensors have become common with the use of DT-MRI. But the classical Euclidean framework has many defects, and affine-invariant Riemannian metrics have been proposed to correct them. These metrics have excellent theoretical properties but lead to complex and slow algorithms. To remedy this limitation, we propose new metrics called Log-Euclidean. They also have excellent theoretical properties and yield similar results in practice, but with much simpler and faster computations. Indeed, Log-Euclidean computations are Euclidean computations in the domain of matrix logarithms. Theoretical aspects are presented and experimental results for multilinear interpolation and regularization of tensor fields are shown on synthetic and real DTI data.},

abstract = {There is a need for, and utility in, the acquisition of data sets of cardiac histoanatomy, with the vision of reconstructing individual hearts on the basis of noninvasive imaging, such as MRI, enriched by reference to detailed atlases of serial histology obtained from representative samples. These data sets would be useful not only as a repository of knowledge regarding the specifics of cardiac histoanatomy, but could form the basis for generation of individualized high-resolution cardiac structure-function models. The current article presents a step in this general direction: it illustrates how whole-heart noninvasive imaging can be combined with whole-heart histology in an approach to achieve automated construction of histoanatomically detailed models of cardiac 3D structure and function at hitherto unprecedented resolution and accuracy (based on 26.4 x 26.4 x 24.4 microm MRI voxel size, and enriched by histological detail). It provides an overview of the tools used in this quest and outlines challenges posed by the approach in the light of applications that may benefit from the availability of such data and tools.},

abstract = {To fully understand the mechanisms of defibrillation, it is critical to know how a given electrical stimulus causes membrane polarizations in cardiac tissue. We have extended the concept of the activating function, originally used to describe neuronal stimulation, to derive a new expression that identifies the sources that drive changes in transmembrane potential. Source terms, or virtual electrodes, consist of either second derivatives of extracellular potential weighted by intracellular conductivity or extracellular potential gradients weighted by derivatives of intracellular conductivity. The full response of passive tissue can be considered, in simple cases, to be a convolution of this "generalized activating function" with the impulse response of the tissue. Computer simulations of a two-dimensional sheet of passive myocardium under steady-state conditions demonstrate that this source term is useful for estimating the effects of applied electrical stimuli. The generalized activating function predicts oppositely polarized regions of tissue when unequally anisotropic tissue is point stimulated and a monopolar response when a point stimulus is applied to isotropic tissue. In the bulk of the myocardium, this new expression is helpful for understanding mechanisms by which virtual electrodes can be produced, such as the hypothetical "sawtooth" pattern of polarization, as well as polarization owing to regions of depressed conductivity, missing cells or clefts, changes in fiber diameter, or fiber curvature. In comparing solutions obtained with an assumed extracellular potential distribution to those with fully coupled intra- and extracellular domains, we find that the former provides a reliable estimate of the total solution. Thus the generalized activating function that we have derived provides a useful way of understanding virtual electrode effects in cardiac tissue.},

abstract = {Quantitative assessment of myofiber disarray associated with diseases such as familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) can be performed by estimating local angular deviation of fiber orientation in histologic sections. The large number of measurements required to estimate angular deviation prohibits manual measurement. We describe methods for automated measurement of local orientation and angular deviation in tissue sections from transgenic mice with ventricular expression of ras, proposed as a model of FHC.Images of histologic tissue sections from normal and transgenic mice were analyzed using image processing techniques to estimate local orientation of myofibers. Results from the automated methods were compared with manual measurements.Automated methods estimated differing mean orientation in 7-20\% of normal sections and 17-29\% of transgenic tissue sections with differing dispersions in 23-30\% of normal sections and 25\% of transgenic tissue sections. Automated methods estimate 24.47 +/- 13.03\% of total ventricular mass affected by disarray that is comparable to a previous estimate of 21.7\% in the same mouse model.Automated methods are a rapid and accurate alternative to manual measurement for estimation of mean orientation and angular deviation in myocardial tissue sections. Differences between manual and automated methods may be attributed to the substantially larger number of measurements made by automated methods. Automated methods are particularly appropriate for use in determining local variation in orientation such as focal myofiber disarray associated with FHC. The generality of these methods suggests they may have use in other biological fields such as quantifying cellular alignment. Anat Rec. 252:612-625, 1998. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Transmembrane Potential Changes with Stimulation. Electrical stimuli pace, cardiovert, or defibrillate the heart by changing transmembrane potential (Delta Vm), Recent simulation studies provide insights into mechanisms by which stimuli establish Delta Vm. This review attempts a nonmathematical description of these mechanisms. We start with the cable model in which the intracellular core conductor is bounded by a highly resistive and capacitive membrane that separates the intracellular and extracellular spaces, Intracellular and extracellular resistances are assumed to vary linearly with position. Although this model predicts anodal extracellular stimuli hyperpolarize adjacent tissue and cathodal extracellular stimuli depolarize that tissue, it fails to reproduce regions of opposite Delta Vm distant from the electrodes. We then consider the sawtooth model in which microscopic discontinuities in intracellular resistance represent gap junctions, While model studies with such discontinuities demonstrate large Delta Vm at cell ends, experimental validation of such Delta Vm remains elusive. Extending the analysis to the two- and three-dimensional syncytium, we also consider the bidomain model in which intracellular, extracellular, and interstitial currents are explicitly characterized. Differences in resistance to these currents gives rise to virtual electrodes, which are experimentally observed regions of large Delta Vm that arise distant from the stimulating electrode. Distant Delta Vm regions are also evident when macroscopic discontinuities in intracellular resistance are introduced into the bidomain model. Such discontinuities are associated with clefts or scars that give rise to "secondary sources." Albeit the cable model offers remarkable insight the bidomain model and the concept of secondary sources provide a more complete understanding of membrane excitation, especially when combined into a unifying activating function.},

@article{Anderson2009,
abstract = {The arrangement of the myocytes aggregated together within the ventricular walls has been the subject of anatomic investigation for more than four centuries. The dangers of analyzing the myocardium on the basis of arrangement of the skeletal myocytes have long been appreciated, yet some still described the ventricular myocardium in terms of a unique band extending from the pulmonary trunk to the aorta. Another current interpretation, with much support, is that the ventricular myocytes are compartmentalized in the form of sheets, albeit that the extent of division, and interrelations, of the sheets is less well explained. Histological examination, however, shows that the only muscular unit to be found within the myocardial walls is the cardiac myocyte itself. Our own investigations show that, rather than forming a continuous band, or being arranged as sheets, the myocytes are aggregated together as a three-dimensional mesh within a supporting matrix of fibrous tissue. Within the mesh of aggregated myocytes, it is then possible to recognize two populations, depending on the orientations of their long axes. The first population is aligned with the long axis of the aggregated myocytes tangential to the epicardial and endocardial borders, albeit with marked variation in the angulation relative to the ventricular equator. Correlation with measurements taken using force probes shows that these myocytes produce the major unloading of the blood during ventricular systole. The second population is aligned at angles of up to 40 degrees from the epicardium toward the endocardium. The correlation with measurements from force probes reveals that these intruding myocytes produce auxotonic forces during the cardiac cycle. The three-dimensional arrangement of the mesh also serves to account for the realignment of the myocytes that must take place during ventricular contraction so as to account for the extent of systolic mural thickening.},

@article{Xie2009,
annote = {The distribution of ventricular cell and tissue types is important in the initiation and maintenance of arrhythmia. For example, fibroblasts alter conduction velocity and refractoriness through several mechanisms. Traditionally, only cardiomyocyte decoupling was considered important, where fibroblasts act as passive insulating barriers, creating convoluted ‘zigzag’ conduction pathways and retarding propagation (3, 4). Recent experimental studies have documented that functional gap junctions form between fibroblasts and myocytes (8, 9, 10). Gap junctions affect propagation in three main ways.  Firstly, the conductivity facilitated by the junctions enhances propagation, allowing fibroblasts to transduce activation between otherwise unconnected myocytes (6, 14). Secondly and contrastingly, the junctions cause electrotonic loading; fibroblasts act as capacitors coupled to the myocytes, absorbing ionic currents and delaying myocyte activation (18, Xie). Finally, the coupling elevates myocyte resting membrane potential, causing conduction velocity first to increase and then to decrease with increasing fibroblast concentration and/or gap junction conductance, until finally conduction failure occurs (13, Xie). Fibroblasts also modulate myocyte behaviour via the release of paracrine factors [Cardiac fibroblast paracrine factors alter impulse conduction and ion channel expression of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Cardiovascular Research 2009;83:688–697]. A recent computational study $\backslash$cite\{Xie:2009\} suggests that this mechanism adds to the range, complexity and significance of the two cell types' mutual interaction, whilst conceding: "A second major limitation relates to simulating laminar sheet structures using a 2D model, which may obscure potentially important 3D transfiber effects of the laminar clefts. A real 3D structure is needed for further study, ideally modeled on a realistic representation of 3D cell distribution and coupling."},

abstract = {Little is known about the three-dimensional (3-D) intramural activation sequences during long-duration ventricular fibrillation (VF), including the role of the subendocardium and its Purkinje fibers (PFs) in long-duration VF maintenance. Our aim was to explore the mechanism of long-duration VF maintenance with 3-D electrical mapping. We recorded 10 min of electrically induced VF in the left ventricular anterior free wall of six 10-kg, open-chest dogs using a 3-D transmural unipolar electrode matrix (9 x 9 x 6, 2-mm spacing) that allowed us to map intramural activation sequences. At 2.5 + or - 1.8 min of VF, although the body surface ECG continued to exhibit a disorganized VF pattern, intramurally a more organized, synchronous activation pattern was first observed [locally synchronized VF (LSVF)]. This pattern occurred one or more times in all dogs and was present 33.4 + or - 31.4\% of the time during 5-10 min of VF. As opposed to the preceding changing complex activation sequences of VF, during LSVF, wavefronts were large and highly repeatable near the endocardium, first exciting the endocardium almost simultaneously and then rapidly spreading toward the epicardium with different levels of conduction block en route. During LSVF, PF activations always preceded working myocardium activations near the endocardium. In conclusion, long-duration VF in dogs frequently becomes highly organized in the subendocardium, with activation fronts arising in this region and passing intramurally toward the epicardium, even though the surface ECG continues to exhibit a disorganized pattern. PFs appear to play an important role during this stage of VF.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The relative importance of nonuniform dispersion of refractoriness, steep restitution slopes, and anatomic heterogeneities in causing conduction block during ventricular fibrillation (VF) remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: In six open-chest pigs, ventricular refractoriness and restitution curves were estimated from activation recovery intervals (ARIs) calculated from 504 (21 x 24) unipolar electrode recordings 2 mm apart in a plaque sutured to the left ventricular (LV) free wall. A steady-state restitution protocol was performed twice at each of two pacing sites: the LV base and near the left anterior descending artery. VF was electrically induced four times and the incidence of conduction block at each electrode during the first 20 seconds was determined by an automated algorithm. The gradient of the ARI was calculated at each electrode to estimate the spatial dispersion of refractoriness. An exponential curve was fit to the restitution plots of ARIs versus the corresponding diastolic intervals (DIs) for all pacing cycle lengths at each electrode. The locations of epicardial blood vessels were noted after the study. Spatial patterns of conduction block were significantly correlated between the four VF episodes in the same animal (r = 0.66 +/- 0.07, P < 0.05). At the shortest pacing cycle length, the spatial distribution of ARIs, ARI gradients, and restitution slopes was not random but formed clusters of similar values. However, none of these variables was significantly correlated with the incidence of conduction block, even though ARI gradients >2 msec/mm were present between many clusters and approximately 90\% of restitution slopes were >1. Instead, conduction block frequently appeared to cluster along epicardial vessels. CONCLUSION: Neither the dispersion of refractoriness nor action potential duration restitution determined during rapid pacing by itself is the major determinant of the location of conduction block during early VF in normal pigs. It may be that these factors interact synergistically with each other as well as with other factors, including anatomic heterogeneities such as those caused by blood vessels, which may be particularly important for the formation of conduction block and maintenance of VF.},

abstract = {Confocal microscopy enables constitutive elements of cells and tissues to be viewed at high resolution and reconstructed in three dimensions, but is constrained by the limited extent of the volumes that can be imaged. We have developed an automated technique that enables serial confocal images to be acquired over large tissue areas and volumes. The computer-controlled system, which integrates a confocal microscope and an ultramill using a high-precision translation stage, inherently preserves specimen registration, and the user control interface enables flexible specification of imaging protocols over a wide range of scales and resolutions. With this system it is possible to reconstruct specified morphological features in three dimensions and locate them accurately throughout a tissue sample. We have successfully imaged various samples at 1-mum voxel resolution on volumes up to 4 mm3 and on areas up to 75 mm2. Used in conjunction with appropriate embedding media and immuno-histochemical probes, the techniques described in this paper make it possible to routinely map the distributions of key intracellular structures over much larger tissue domains than has been easily achievable in the past.},

abstract = {Structural remodeling of the myocardium associated with mechanical overload or cardiac infarction is accompanied by the appearance of myofibroblasts. These fibroblast-like cells express alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA) and have been shown to express connexins in tissues other than heart. The present study examined whether myofibroblasts of cardiac origin establish heterocellular gap junctional coupling with cardiomyocytes and whether ensuing electrotonic interactions affect impulse propagation. For this purpose, impulse conduction characteristics (conduction velocity [theta] and maximal upstroke velocity [dV/dt(max)]) were assessed optically in cultured strands of cardiomyocytes, which were coated with fibroblasts of cardiac origin. Immunocytochemistry showed that cultured fibroblasts underwent a phenotype switch to alpha SMA-positive myofibroblasts that expressed connexin 43 and 45 both among themselves and at contact sites with cardiomyocytes. Myofibroblasts affected theta and dV/dt(max) in a cell density-dependent manner; a gradual increase of myofibroblast-to-cardiomyocyte ratios up to 7:100 caused an increase of both theta and dV/dt(max), which was followed by a progressive decline at higher ratios. On full coverage of the strands with myofibroblasts (ratio > 20:100), theta fell < 200 mm/s. This biphasic dependence of theta and dV/dt(max) on myofibroblast density is reminiscent of "supernormal conduction" and is explained by a myofibroblast density-dependent gradual depolarization of the cardiomyocyte strands from -78 mV to -50 mV as measured using microelectrode recordings. These findings suggest that myofibroblasts, apart from their role in structural remodeling, might contribute to arrhythmogenesis by direct electrotonic modulation of conduction and that prevention of their appearance might represent an antiarrhythmic therapeutic target.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study examines the consequences of a large transmural apical infarct on the epicardial electrical activity in isolated rabbit hearts. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hearts were isolated 8 weeks after coronary artery ligation. Membrane voltage from the epicardial surface of the left ventricle (LV) including the infarct was monitored using the voltage sensitive dye RH237. Optical action potentials were detected from the epicardial surface of the infarct; the signal amplitude was approximately 20\% of those in the noninfarcted zone (NZ). Epicardial activation mapping of the LV free wall showed that during right atrial (RA) pacing, the activation sequence was not significantly different between infarcted and sham-operated groups. However, direct stimulation of the epicardium in the NZ revealed an area of slow conduction velocity (CV approximately 5 cm/s(-1), approximately 10\% of normal values) at the margin of the infarct zone (IZ). Within the IZ, CV was approximately 50\% of normal. A prominent endocardial rim of myocardium in the infarct was not the source of epicardial optical signals because chemical ablation of the endocardium did not affect the epicardial activation pattern. CONCLUSION: Therefore, remnant groups of myocytes in the mid-wall and epicardium of the infarct scar support normal electrical activation during RA pacing. Areas of delayed conduction emerge only on epicardial stimulation.},

abstract = {Voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes are commonly used to measure cardiac electrical activity. Recent studies indicate, however, that optical action potentials (OAPs) recorded from the myocardial surface originate from a widely distributed volume beneath the surface and may contain useful information regarding intramural activation. The first step toward obtaining this information is to predict OAPs from known patterns of three-dimensional (3-D) electrical activity. To achieve this goal, we developed a two-stage model in which the output of a 3-D ionic model of electrical excitation serves as the input to an optical model of light scattering and absorption inside heart tissue. The two-stage model permits unique optical signatures to be obtained for given 3-D patterns of electrical activity for direct comparison with experimental data, thus yielding information about intramural electrical activity. To illustrate applications of the model, we simulated surface fluorescence signals produced by 3-D electrical activity during epicardial and endocardial pacing. We discovered that OAP upstroke morphology was highly sensitive to the transmural component of wave front velocity and could be used to predict wave front orientation with respect to the surface. These findings demonstrate the potential of the model for obtaining useful 3-D information about intramural propagation.},

However, no currently available detailed action potential model accurately reproduces the dynamics of the cardiac action potential and intracellular calcium (Ca(i)) cycling at rapid heart rates relevant to ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. The aim of this study was to develop such a model. Using an existing rabbit ventricular action potential model, we modified the L-type calcium (Ca) current (I(Ca,L)) and Ca(i) cycling formulations based on new experimental patch-clamp data obtained in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes, using the perforated patch configuration at 35-37 degrees C. Incorporating a minimal seven-state Markovian model of I(Ca,L) that reproduced Ca- and voltage-dependent kinetics in combination with our previously published dynamic Ca(i) cycling model, the new model replicates experimentally observed action potential duration and Ca(i) transient alternans at rapid heart rates, and accurately reproduces experimental action potential duration restitution curves obtained by either dynamic or S1S2 pacing.},

abstract = {High-energy defibrillation shock is the only therapy for ventricular tachyarrhythmias. However, because of adverse side effects, lowering defibrillation energy is desirable. We investigated mechanisms of unpinning, destabilization, and termination of ventricular tachycardia (VT) by low-energy shocks in isolated rabbit right ventricular preparations (n = 22). Stable VT was initiated with burst pacing and was optically mapped. Monophasic "unpinning" shocks (10 ms) of different strengths were applied at various phases throughout the reentry cycle. In 8 of 22 preparations, antitachycardia pacing (ATP: 8-20 pulses, 50-105\% of period, 0.8-10 mA) was also applied. Termination of reentry by ATP was achieved in only 5 of 8 preparations. Termination by unpinning occurred in all 22 preparations. Rayleigh's test showed a statistically significant unpinning phase window, during which reentry could be unpinned and subsequently terminated with E80 (magnitude at which 80\% of reentries were unpinned) = 1.2 V/cm. All reentries were unpinned with field strengths < or = 2.4 V/cm. Unpinning was achieved by inducing virtual electrode polarization and secondary sources of excitation at the core of reentry. Optical mapping revealed the mechanisms of phase-dependent unpinning of reentry. These results suggest that a 20-fold reduction in energy could be achieved compared with conventional high-energy defibrillation and that the unpinning method may be more effective than ATP for terminating stable, pinned reentry in this experimental model.},

abstract = {The analysis of surface-activation patterns and measurements of conduction velocity in ventricular myocardium is complicated by the fact that the electrical wavefront has a complex 3D shape and can approach the heart surface at various angles. Recent theoretical studies suggest that the optical upstroke is sensitive to the subsurface orientation of the wavefront. Our goal here was to (1) establish the quantitative relationship between optical upstroke morphology and subsurface wavefront orientation using computer modeling and (2) test theoretical predictions experimentally in isolated coronary-perfused swine right ventricular preparations. We show in numerical simulations that by suitable placement of linear epicardial stimulating electrodes, the angle phi of wavefronts with respect to the heart surface can be controlled. Using this method, we developed theoretical predictions of the optical upstroke shape dependence on phi. We determined that the level VF* at which the rate of rise of the optical upstroke reaches the maximum linearly depends on phi. A similar relationship was found in simulations with epicardial point stimulation. The optical mapping data were in good agreement with theory. Plane waves propagating parallel to myocardial fibers produced upstrokes with VF*<0.5, consistent with theoretical predictions for phi>0. Similarly, we obtained good agreement with theory for plane waves propagating in a direction perpendicular to fibers (VF*>0.5 when phi<0). Finally, during epicardial point stimulation, we discovered characteristic saddle-shaped VF* maps that were in excellent agreement with theoretically predicted changes in phi during wavefront expansion. Our findings should allow for improved interpretation of the results of optical mapping of intact heart preparations.},

Genetic studies in the mouse have been crucial to uncover new genes and signaling pathways associated with heart development and congenital heart disease. The identification of murine models of congenital cardiac malformations in high-throughput mutagenesis screens and in gene-targeted models is hindered by the opacity of the mouse embryo. RESULTS: We developed and optimized a novel method for high-throughput multi-embryo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Using this approach we identified cardiac malformations in phosphatidylserine receptor (Ptdsr) deficient embryos. These included ventricular septal defects, double-outlet right ventricle, and hypoplasia of the pulmonary artery and thymus. These results indicate that Ptdsr plays a key role in cardiac development. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel multi-embryo MRI technique enables high-throughput identification of murine models for human congenital cardiopulmonary malformations at high spatial resolution. The technique can be easily adapted for mouse mutagenesis screens and, thus provides an important new tool for identifying new mouse models for human congenital heart diseases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Aging is associated with a significant increase in atrial tachyarrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation. A macroscopic repolarization gradient created artificially by a stimulus at one site before a premature stimulus from a second site is widely considered to be part of the experimental protocol necessary for the initiation of such arrhythmias in the Laboratory. How such gradients occur naturally in aging atrial tissue is unknown.OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine if the pattern of cellular connectivity in aging human atrial bundles produces a mechanism for variable early premature responses.METHODS Extracellular and intracellular potentials were recorded after control and premature stimuli at a single site in aging human atrial bundles. We also measured cellular geometry, the distribution of connexins, and the distribution of collagenous septa. A model of the atrial bundles was constructed based on the morphological results. Action potential propagation and the sodium current were analyzed after premature stimuli in the model.RESULTS Similar extracellular potential waveform responses occurred after early premature stimuli in the aging bundles and in the model. Variable premature conduction patterns were accounted for by the single model of aging atrial structure. A major feature of the model results was that the conduction events and the magnitude of the sodium current at multiple sites were very sensitive to small changes in the location and the timing of premature stimuli.CONCLUSION In aging human atrial bundles stimulated from only a single site, premature stimuli induce variable arrhythmogenic conduction responses. The generation of these responses is greatly enhanced by remodeling of cellular connectivity during aging. The results provide insight into sodium current structural interactions as a general mechanism of arrhythmogenic atrial responses to premature stimuli.},

abstract = {AIMS: Existence of myocyte-fibroblast coupling in the human heart is still a controversial question. This study aims at investigating in a biophysical model how much coupling would be necessary to perturb significantly the electrical propagation of the cardiac impulse. METHODS AND RESULTS: A one-dimensional model representing a strand of myocytes covered by a layer of fibroblasts was formulated by reinterpreting the coupled myocyte-fibroblast system as a single unit and connecting these units using a monodomain approach. The myocyte membrane kinetics was described by the Bondarenko mouse cell model and the fibroblast response was based on an experimentally measured current-voltage curve and took into account the delayed activation of that current. Conduction and maximal upstroke velocities were reported for different fibroblast densities and myocyte-fibroblast coupling strengths during paced rhythm. A reduction in conduction and maximum upstroke velocities was observed for increasing coupling and fibroblast density, in agreement with cell culture experiments. This effect was because of an increase in the myocyte resting potential and of the fibroblasts acting as a current sink. At least 10 fibroblasts with capacitance 4.5 pF had to be connected to each myocyte with capacitance 153.4 pF to slow down the conduction by >10\%. CONCLUSION: Coupling with fibroblasts affects the myocyte resting potential and the impulse propagation, but microstructural changes and myocyte decoupling are needed to explain slow conduction in fibrotic tissue.},

abstract = {AIMS: The pathological proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) in response to heart injury results in fibrosis, which correlates with arrhythmia generation and heart failure. Here we systematically examined the effect of fibroblast-derived paracrine factors on electrical propagation in cardiomyocytes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Neonatal rat cardiac monolayers were exposed for 24 h to media conditioned by CFs. Optical mapping, sharp microelectrode recordings, quantitative RT-PCR, and immunostaining were used to assess the changes in the propagation and shape of the action potential and underlying changes in gene and protein expression. The fibroblast paracrine factors produced a 52\% reduction in cardiac conduction velocity, a 217\% prolongation of action potential duration, a 64\% decrease of maximum capture rate, a 21\% increase in membrane resting potential, and an 80\% decrease of action potential upstroke velocity. These effects were dose dependent and partially reversible with removal of the conditioned media. No fibroblast proliferation, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, or decreased connexin-43 expression, phosphorylation, and function were found in conditioned cardiac cultures. In contrast, the expression of the fast sodium, inward rectifying potassium, and transient outward potassium channels were, respectively, reduced 3.8-, 6.6-fold, and to undetectable levels. The expression of beta-myosin heavy chain increased 17.4-fold. No electrophysiological changes were observed from media conditioned by CFs in the presence of cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSION: Paracrine factors from neonatal CFs alone produced significant electrophysiological changes in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes resembling those found in several cardiac pathologies.},

We then provide a detailed explanation of a processing pipeline which we have recently developed for constructing realistic computational models of the heart from high resolution structural and diffusion tensor (DT) magnetic resonance (MR) images acquired ex vivo. The presentation of the pipeline incorporates a review of the methodologies that can be used to reconstruct models of cardiac structure. In this pipeline, the structural image is segmented to reconstruct the ventricles, normal myocardium, and infarct. A finite element mesh is generated from the segmented structural image, and fiber orientations are assigned to the elements based on DTMR data. The methods were applied to construct seven different models of healthy and diseased hearts. These models contain millions of elements, with spatial resolutions in the order of hundreds of microns, providing unprecedented detail in the representation of cardiac structure for simulation studies.},

abstract = {The diffusion tensor is currently the accepted model of diffusion in biological tissues. The measured diffusion behavior may be more complex when two or more distinct tissues with different diffusion tensors occupy the same voxel. In this study, a partial volume model of MRI signal behavior for two diffusion-tensor compartments is presented. Simulations using this model demonstrate that the conventional single diffusion tensor model could lead to highly variable and inaccurate measurements of diffusion behavior. The differences between the single and two-tensor models depend on the orientations, fractions, and exchange between the two diffusion tensor compartments, as well as the diffusion-tensor encoding technique and diffusion-weighting that is used in the measurements. The current single compartment model's inaccuracies could cause diffusion-based characterization of cerebral ischemia and white matter connectivity to be incorrect. A diffusion-tensor MRI imaging experiment on a normal human brain revealed significant partial volume effects between oblique white matter regions when using very large voxels and large diffusion-weighting (b approximately 2.69 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)). However, the apparent partial volume effects in white matter decreased significantly when smaller voxel dimensions were used. For diffusion tensor studies obtained using typical diffusion-weighting values (b approximately 1 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)) partial volume effects are much more difficult to detect and resolve. More accurate measurements of multiple diffusion compartments may lead to improved confidence in diffusion measurements for clinical applications.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple excitation wavelets are present during ventricular fibrillation (VF). The underlying wavelet organization of VF is unclear. Phase singularities (PSs)-locations of ambiguous activation state-underlie reentry and wavelet splitting and represent the sources of VF. Understanding the mechanisms of PS formation might be important in the development of effective therapies for sudden death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed voltage, phase, and PS mapping in fibrillating ventricles, applying an automated PS detection algorithm to optically recorded fibrillation signals. PS clustering was noted along epicardial vessels, ridges of endocardial trabeculae, and papillary muscle insertions. Microscopically, these locations correlated with areas of apposition of fibers with different angulations and intramural vessels. A total of 83.2\% of PSs were formed at and meandered about these anatomic structures, which acted as stabilizers: PSs colocalizing at anatomic substrates had longer life spans than nonanatomic PS (82.46+/-60.8 versus 40.5+/-31.9 ms, P<0.01). The RV endocardium had a higher PS incidence than the epicardium (42.3+/-9.2 versus 23.5+/-11.6 PS/s, P<0.01). Autocorrelation showed that irregular behavior was spatially restricted to anatomic heterogeneities compared with other areas, which had nearly periodic behaviors. Simple spatial PS distributions underlay complex and variable activation patterns attributable to variable PS behaviors, life spans, and inter-PS interactions. CONCLUSIONS: PSs occur in a nonrandom spatial distribution and colocalize with normal anatomic heterogeneities. Varying PS behaviors and life spans but stable PS spatial distributions cause ever-changing activation patterns that characterize VF.},

It enjoys several advantages over traditional histological approaches, including the ability to rapidly measure fiber organization in isolated, perfused, arrested hearts, thereby avoiding fixation and sectioning of artifacts. However, quantitative validation of this MRI method has been lacking. Here, fiber orientations estimated in the same locations in the same heart using both diffusion tensor MRI and histology are compared in a total of two perfused rabbit hearts. Fiber orientations were statistically similar for both methods and differed on average by 12 degrees at any single location. This is similar to the 10 degrees uncertainty in fiber orientation achieved with histology. In addition, imaging studies performed in a total of seven hearts support a level of organization beyond the myofiber, the recently described laminar organization of the ventricular myocardium.},

abstract = {In ventricular fibrillation (VF), the principal cause of sudden cardiac death, waves of electrical excitation break up into turbulent and incoherent fragments. The causes of this breakup have been intensely debated. Breakup can be caused by fixed anatomical properties of the tissue, such as the biventricular geometry and the inherent anisotropy of cardiac conduction. However, wavebreak can also be caused purely by instabilities in wave conduction that arise from ion channel dynamics, which represent potential targets for drug action. To study the interaction between these two wave-breaking mechanisms, we used a physiologically based mathematical model of the ventricular cell, together with a realistic three-dimensional computer model of cardiac anatomy, including the distribution of fiber angles throughout the myocardium. We find that dynamical instabilities remain a major cause of the wavebreak that drives VF, even in an anatomically realistic heart. With cell physiology in its usual operating regime, dynamics and anatomical features interact to promote wavebreak and VF. However, if dynamical instability is reduced, for example by modeling of certain pharmacologic interventions, electrical waves do not break up into fibrillation, despite anatomical complexity. Thus, interventions that promote dynamical wave stability show promise as an antifibrillatory strategy in this more realistic setting.},

@article{Jalife2000,
abstract = {Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the major immediate cause of sudden cardiac death. Traditionally, VF has been defined as turbulent cardiac electrical activity, which implies a large amount of irregularity in the electrical waves that underlie ventricular excitation. During VF, the heart rate is too high (> 550 excitations/minute) to allow adequate pumping of blood. In the electrocardiogram (ECG), ventricular complexes that are ever-changing in frequency, contour, and amplitude characterize VF. This article reviews prevailing theories for the initiation and maintenance of VF, as well as its spatio-temporal organization. Particular attention is given to recent experiments and computer simulations suggesting that VF may be explained in terms of highly periodic three-dimensional rotors that activate the ventricles at exceedingly high frequency. Such rotors may show at least two different behaviors: (a) At one extreme, they may drift throughout the heart at high speeds producing beat-to-beat changes in the activation sequence. (b) At the other extreme, rotors may be relatively stationary, activating the ventricles at such high frequencies that the wave fronts emanating from them breakup at varying distances, resulting in complex spatio-temporal patterns of fibrillatory conduction. In either case, the recorded ECG patterns are indistinguishable from VF. The data discussed have paved the way for a better understanding of the mechanisms of VF in the normal, as well as the diseased, human heart.},

abstract = {We present the detailed planning and execution of the Insight Toolkit (ITK), an application programmers interface (API) for the segmentation and registration of medical image data. This public resource has been developed through the NLM Visible Human Project, and is in beta test as an open-source software offering under cost-free licensing. The toolkit concentrates on 3D medical data segmentation and registration algorithms, multimodal and multiresolution capabilities, and portable platform independent support for Windows, Linux/Unix systems. This toolkit was built using current practices in software engineering. Specifically, we embraced the concept of generic programming during the development of these tools, working extensively with C++ templates and the freedom and flexibility they allow. Software development tools for distributed consortium-based code development have been created and are also publicly available. We discuss our assumptions, design decisions, and some lessons learned.},

abstract = {Models of cardiac tissue electrophysiology are an important component of the Cardiac Physiome Project, which is an international effort to build biophysically based multi-scale mathematical models of the heart. Models of tissue electrophysiology can provide a bridge between electrophysiological cell models at smaller scales, and tissue mechanics, metabolism and blood flow at larger scales. This paper is a critical review of cardiac tissue electrophysiology models, focussing on the micro-structure of cardiac tissue, generic behaviours of action potential propagation, different models of cardiac tissue electrophysiology, the choice of parameter values and tissue geometry, emergent properties in tissue models, numerical techniques and computational issues. We propose a tentative list of information that could be included in published descriptions of tissue electrophysiology models, and used to support interpretation and evaluation of simulation results. We conclude with a discussion of challenges and open questions.},

@article{Gilbert2007,
abstract = {The architecture of the heart remains controversial despite extensive effort and recent advances in imaging techniques. Several opposing and non-mutually compatible models have been proposed to explain cardiac structure, and these models, although limited, have advanced the study and understanding of heart structure, function and development. We describe key areas of similarity and difference, highlight areas of contention and point to the important limitations of these models. Recent research in animal models on the nature, geometry and interaction of cardiac sheet structure allows unification of some seemingly conflicting features of the structural models. Intriguingly, evidence points to significant inter-individual structural variability (within constrained limits) in the canine, leading to the concept of a continuum (or distribution) of cardiac structures. This variability in heart structure partly explains the ongoing debate on myocardial architecture. These developments are used to construct an integrated description of cardiac structure unifying features of fibre, sheet and band architecture that provides a basis for (i) explaining cardiac electromechanics, (ii) computational simulations of cardiac physiology and (iii) designing interventions.},

@article{Roth1998,
abstract = {This review examines the initiation of reentry in cardiac muscle by strong electric shocks. Specifically, it concentrates on the mechanisms by which electric shocks change the transmembrane potential of the cardiac membrane and create the physiological substrate required by the critical point theory for the initiation of rotors. The mechanisms examined include (1) direct polarization of the tissue by the stimulating current, as described by the one-dimensional cable model and its two- and three-dimensional extensions, (2) the presence of virtual anodes and cathodes, as described by the bidomain model with unequal anisotropy ratios of the intra- and extracellular spaces, (3) polarization of the tissue due to changing orientation of cardiac fibers, and (4) polarization of individual cells or groups of cells by the electric field ("sawtooth potential"). The importance of these mechanisms in the initiation of reentry is examined in two case studies: the induction of rotors using successive stimulation with a unipolar electrode, and the induction of rotors using cross-field stimulation. These cases reveal that the mechanism by which a unipolar stimulation induces arrhythmias can be explained in the framework of the bidomain model with unequal anisotropy ratios. In contrast, none of the examined mechanisms provide an adequate explanation for the induction of rotors by cross-field stimulation. Hence, this study emphasizes the need for further experimental and theoretical work directed toward explaining the mechanism of field stimulation. (c) 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {This paper presents methods to build histo-anatomically detailed individualized cardiac models. The models are based on high-resolution three-dimensional anatomical and/or diffusion tensor magnetic resonance images, combined with serial histological sectioning data, and are used to investigate individualized cardiac function. The current state of the art is reviewed, and its limitations are discussed. We assess the challenges associated with the generation of histo-anatomically representative individualized in silico models of the heart. The entire processing pipeline including image acquisition, image processing, mesh generation, model set-up and execution of computer simulations, and the underlying methods are described. The multifaceted challenges associated with these goals are highlighted, suitable solutions are proposed, and an important application of developed high-resolution structure-function models in elucidating the effect of individual structural heterogeneity upon wavefront dynamics is demonstrated.},
