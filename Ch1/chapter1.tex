\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:intro:motivation}
  Sudden cardiac death is the leading global cause of mortality, accounting for 39\% of all deaths in the UK. The economic cost due to the disease totals \pounds9 billion in this country alone. Ventricular fibrillation is a central aspect to many of these fatalities. However, many of the fundamental mechanisms underlying their onset, maintenance and termination are poorly understood, and effective therapies based on this understanding remain out of reach.
  
  Over the last century, experimental investigations into cardiac function during physiological and pathological conditions have allowed the general processes which produce arrhythmias to be characterised. In recent decades, experimental investigations have been complemented by computational and mathematical models which aim to simulate the biochemical, mechanical and electrophysiological function and dysfunction of the heart. The frequent validation of computational models with experimental data and use of modelling to guide new experimentation is bringing a new level to the understanding of cardiac function. This marriage of in silico and experimental investigation has made increasingly clear the important large-scale functional effects of small-scale anatomical structure. Very recently, several experimental techniques have provided high resolution data on both myocardial tissue structure and on healthy and pathological wavefront dynamics \cite{Burton2006,Plank2009,Bishop2009}. These advances notwithstanding, fine anatomical detail remains absent from the latest models and the effect of structure on wavefront dynamics has yet to be computationally investigated. This investigation will bring us closer to a profound and predictive understanding of arrhythmia and will eventually lead to more effective therapies to combat acute heart disease.

\section{Aims}
\label{sec:intro:aims}
It is the wider aim of the thesis to develop a framework via which the role of microstructure in arrhythmia and electrophysiological pathology may be investigated, based upon information from the latest imaging techniques and leveraging state of the art high performance computing facilities. The chapter concludes by delineating the specific thesis aims and summarising the document structure. Guided by experimental findings, we aim to demonstrate the importance of blood vessels and myocardial anisotropy in electropropagation. We aim to construct accurate and detailed 3-D images from high quality histology data at the tissue and whole-organ scale, and then to generate 3-D tissue models based on this characterisation. To do so, new tools and algorithms need to be developed. Using these models, the way will be paved to quantify and classify the relative wavefront propagative changes due to epicardial vessels, myocardial fibres and tissue distributions. Applying both focussed and organ scale simulation, we aim to explore how anatomical detail feeds into the prevention, the onset, the stabilisation and the subsequent rectification of arrythmias.

\section{Exegesis}
\label{sec:intro:exegesis}
  The next chapter introduces some central underpinnings of the thesis, with an overview of cardiac anatomy and electrophysiology, and of modelling and imaging techniques. A thorough literature review follows in Chapter~3, showcasing the experimental and computational evidence that inhomogeneities in tissue direct electrical dynamics. It also outlines the state of the art in computational modelling and simulation, and reviews the attempts made so far in the imaging of cardiac tissue. Chapter~4 describes an initial study that reflects experimental findings, showing that epicardial arteries anchor phase singularities and prolong arrhythmic episodes, but that this anchoring is reduced by the smooth negotiation of myocardial fibres around the vessels. Chapter~5 presents the automated construction of a geometrically precise 3-D histological tissue map, based on a set of coherent block face reference images. Chapter~6 leads directly from here, detailing a novel, robust and highly-performant registration method that improves greatly upon the results from Chapter~5. Chapter~7 concludes with a brief feasibility analysis of the extraction of microstructural features for simulation.
